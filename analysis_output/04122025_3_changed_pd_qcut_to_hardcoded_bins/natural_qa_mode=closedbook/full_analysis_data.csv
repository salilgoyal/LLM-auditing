Gear trains are also used in some applications of robotics, where they may be called robot drives. They are also used in some precision measuring instruments, such as dial gauges. In these applications gear trains allow the production of high ratios of torque multiplication or speed reduction with a minimal amount of noise and friction. They are also used in some musical instruments such as the accordion and the zither. In these cases gear trains provide flexibility in achieving the necessary musical tones and pitch control. Gear trains are also used in some aircraft applications, such as propellers and aircraft control surfaces.

It was first discovered in the United States in 2002 in Michigan. The emerald ash borer is native to Asia, where it has caused extensive damage to ash tree populations. In the United States, it has spread to numerous other states, causing significant harm to ash tree populations and disrupting ecosystems. The emerald ash borer is a migratory species, capable of long-distance travel and dispersal through wind and animal transport of infested firewood, planting materials, and shipping containers. Its rapid spread and destructive effects on ash trees have prompted efforts to monitor and control its distribution, including the implementation of management techniques and the development of biocontrols. In addition to Michigan, other states where the emerald ash borer is established include Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, and North and South Carolina.

The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. In the somatic nervous system, the cranial nerves innervate the head and thoracic nerves innervate the thorax and abdomen. The nerves that branch out of the brain are called cranial nerves. The nerves that branch out of the spinal cord are called spinal nerves. The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.

Plasmodesmata are composed of lipids, proteins, and other organic molecules and form complex three-dimensional structures that play essential roles in maintaining cell shape, facilitating communication and transport within cells, and enabling the detection and response to mechanical cues in the environment. They have distinctive mechanical properties and can respond to external forces by changing shape or moving relative to the cell membrane. Plasmodesmata are believed to contribute to cellular adaptability and resilience in response to changing environmental conditions. They play a crucial role in maintaining cell shape and facilitating various cellular processes such as signaling, nutrient transport, and mechanical sensing. Their ability to deform and reconfigure in response to mechanical stimuli allows cells to interact with their surroundings and adapt to changing conditions. Plasmodesmata consist of a thin sheet of lipid molecules arranged in a curved or folded configuration. These structures form a dynamic interface between the cell and its environment, enabling cells to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli.

Other common causes include coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and valvular heart disease.

The UDHR establishes, among other things, that all people are born free and equal, and that these rights shall be protected by law. It has been translated into more than 500 languages and is considered a fundamental text of the human rights movement. The declaration was drafted by a committee of lawyers, politicians, and activists representing 50 countries between November 1943 and July 1948. The document was based on earlier drafts and proposals, including the Declaration of Human Rights of the League of Nations, the Rights of Man and Citizen proposal of Winston Churchill, and the principles expressed in the Charter of the United Nations. The UN General Assembly chose December 10, 1948, as the adoption date to coincide with the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence of the United States.
