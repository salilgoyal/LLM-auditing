| Low         | Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Clara has two  | Steven has 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 books. Alice has 10  |
|             | times as many books as Steven. If Clara has 20     | + 6=<<10+6=16>>16 books. Clara has 20 -            |
|             | boo...                                             | 16=<<20-16=4>>4 more books than Alice. The answer  |
|             |                                                    | is 4. |  Let's say Steven has x books. Then Alice  |
