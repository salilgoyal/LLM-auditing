The physician offers to discuss the advantages and limitations of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test in diagnosing prostate cancer. He mentions that a a serum PSA of 4 ng/mL is generally used as a cutoff value. At this cutoff, the test has a sensitivity of 21% for detecting any prostate cancer and 51% for detecting high-risk prostate cancer, with a specificity of 91%. In patients without urinary retention, hematuria, back pain, or incontinence, the positive predictive value for PSA > 4 ng/mL is estimated at 30% and the negative predictive value for PSA ≤ 4 ng/mL at 85%.

The parents report that the child is sleeping in regular two-hour intervals and feeding and stooling well. They are concerned because they have on occasion noticed a “swelling of the belly button.” Cord separation occurred at seven days of age. The parents report that the swelling seems to come and go but is never larger than the size of a blueberry. They deny any drainage from the swelling. On physical exam, the child is in no acute distress and appears developmentally appropriate for her age. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender with a soft, 1 cm bulge at the umbilicus. The bulge increases in size when the child cries and can be easily reduced inside the umbilical ring without apparent pain.

981,id12682,"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
