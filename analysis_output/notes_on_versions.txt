Uses pd.qcut to create 3 categories of agreement levels for queries in a given benchmark
# Create agreement groups based on std
benchmark_df['agreement_level'] = pd.qcut(benchmark_df['std'], n_groups, labels=['High', 'Medium', 'Low'])

04092025 through 04122025_3

all analyses are only done for version v1.0.0

 04122025_3

 - changed pd.qcut to hardcoded bins: std 0-0.15 = high agreement, 0.15-0.3 = medium agreement, >0.3 = Low

04122025_4

- changed the format of the `analysis_summary.txt` files so that for all questions they also display the correct answer
    (or all the mutiple-choice answers along with which one is the correct one)
- in the top right histogram also added the standard dev ranges for each of 3 categories (which are still hardcoded)
