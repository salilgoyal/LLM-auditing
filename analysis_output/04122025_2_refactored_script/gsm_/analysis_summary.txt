| High        | Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite    | Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at a rate of 2 miles / 40 minutes = <<2/40=0.05>>0.05 miles /     |
|             | walking trail, which includes 2 miles of walking   | minute. Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at a rate of 2 * 0.05 miles / minute =                  |

| Low         | Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Clara has two  | Steven has 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 books. Alice has 10 + 6=<<10+6=16>>16 books. Clara has 20 -            |
|             | times as many books as Steven. If Clara has 20     | 16=<<20-16=4>>4 more books than Alice. The answer is 4.  Let's say Steven has x books. Then Alice    |

|             |                                                    | 16 books. Clara has 20 books. So Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice. The answer is 4.       |

|             |                                                    | has 6 more books than Steven, meaning she has 40 books + 6 books = <<40+6=46>>46 books. Clara has 40 |
|             |                                                    | books - 46 books = <<40-46=-6>> - 6 books more than Alice. The answer is -6.                         |
