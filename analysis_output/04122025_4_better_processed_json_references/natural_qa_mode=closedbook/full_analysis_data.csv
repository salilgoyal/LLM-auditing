The electrons come from the oxidation of glucose and other molecules in the cell. The electron transport chain is a series of protein complexes found in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Each complex is made up of a protein and a coenzyme that accepts electrons. The chain starts with the electron donor molecules and ends with the production of ATP. The chain uses the energy from the electrons to create the potential to move protons (H+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient (ATP synthase uses this gradient to produce ATP). The chain has 14 protein complexes, each of which has a different role in the chain. The chain works to move the electrons from the NADH and FADH2 molecules to the oxygen molecule, resulting in the formation of water.

In the United States, it has spread to numerous other states, causing significant harm to ash tree populations and disrupting ecosystems. The emerald ash borer is a migratory species, capable of long-distance travel and dispersal through wind and animal transport of infested firewood, planting materials, and shipping containers. Its rapid spread and destructive effects on ash trees have prompted efforts to monitor and control its distribution, including the implementation of management techniques and the development of biocontrols.

The main function of the PNS is to connect the central nervous system (CNS) to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as a communication relay going back and forth between the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not protected by the bone of spine and skull, or by the blood–brain barrier, which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. In the somatic nervous system, the cranial nerves innervate the head and thoracic nerves innervate the thorax and abdomen. The nerves that branch out of the brain are called cranial nerves. The nerves that branch out of the spinal cord are called spinal nerves. The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.

Somatic nerves control voluntary actions of the body, like movement and sensation. The autonomic nervous system has two parts: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system, which work together to help the body respond to situations automatically, like when a person is hungry or needs to rest. The PNS is important for maintaining homeostasis, as it helps the body respond to changes in the environment and regulates the activity of different organs and systems. It also plays a role in the perception of pain and touch. ",0.26966292134831465," The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is a network of nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord.

It is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated higher than normal (130/80 mmHg or higher). The right ventricle of the heart has to pump blood against high blood pressure to the rest of the body, therefore, hypertension can put a strain on the right ventricle and lead to heart failure. Other common causes include coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and valvular heart disease. In some cases, right ventricular heart failure can also occur due to arrhythmias or damage caused by diseases such as diabetes or obesity.
