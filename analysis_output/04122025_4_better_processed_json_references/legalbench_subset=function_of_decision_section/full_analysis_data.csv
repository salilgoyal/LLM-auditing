When Jones did pause and look back towards Officer Turner, reaching up in a gesture suggesting he was removing earbuds, Officer Turner could have drawn an alternative, non-suspicious inference from Jones's failing to respond and continuing to walk away from her: He could have been listening to loud music and initially failed to hear her calling out. But the district court found that when Turner commanded Jones to stop she could not see that Jones was wearing headphones, and the court determined that it was reasonable for her to treat Jones's nonresponsiveness as grounds for suspicion.

That a member of the public could look at M-Class's compliance history, notice that there was a terminated § 103(k) order and conclude “something occurred at that mine that affected the health and safety of miners,” Sec'y of Labor v. M-Class Mining, LLC, 42 FMSHRC 491, 496 (2020) (emphasis in original), is no more than a thinly-veiled reputational harm argument. Reputational harm, however, does not provide us with jurisdiction here. “Reputational harm may constitute an ongoing, redressable injury where it derives directly from an unexpired and unretracted government action,” Pulphus v. Ayers, 909 F.3d 1148, 1153 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (internal quotations omitted); for example, if “a governmental designation directly harmed the plaintiff's professional reputation because the designation was inherently stigmatizing,” id. In other words, “when injury to reputation is alleged as a secondary effect of an otherwise moot action, we have required that some tangible, concrete effect remain, susceptible to judicial correction.” Id. at 1154 (internal quotations omitted). Any reputational harm to M-Class is tied to the possibility that someone might check M-Class's history of accidents and might draw a negative conclusion because of the terminated Order. Compared to the reputational harms discussed in Pulphus, M-Class's alleged reputational harm is distinguishable based both on no inherent stigmatization and on the uncertainty of reputational harm. Id. That the Order indicates “something” occurred in M-Class's mine, without assignment of fault or causation, differs greatly from an act of the Congress embodying a determination that an individual was a child abuser and danger to his own daughter, Foretich v.

But as the Ninth Circuit observed in Blaxland, a claim against a foreign state for wrongfully “invoking the extradition procedures” involves an “abuse of process” within the meaning of § 1605(a)(5)(B). Blaxland, 323 F.3d at 1204. Whether the term “abuse of process” is “defined according to a uniform federal standard or according to applicable state law”—here, District of Columbia or New York law—the term “concern[s] the wrongful use of legal process,” including an alleged effort to “misuse[ ] legal procedures to detain” or “extradite” someone.

In 1959, Bill Markham, an experienced game designer and the head of a California-based product development company, was approached by Rueben Klamer, a toy developer with extensive industry contacts. Klamer had just visited Milton Bradley's Massachusetts headquarters, where he had been asked to develop an idea for a product that would commemorate the company's 1960 centennial. While searching for inspiration in the company's archive, he discovered a copy of the company's first board game: “The Checkered Game of Life,” created by Milton Bradley himself in 1860. The original game was intended to instill its youthful players with lessons about vice and virtue. Klamer saw potential in an updated version, modified to reflect contemporary American society and values. On the trip back to California, Klamer developed the concept, even scribbling some thoughts on the flight home. Klamer was more of an ideas person, though, and he needed help developing the concept and creating a working prototype that could be pitched to Milton Bradley. Klamer chose Markham's firm partly because of two talented artists who worked there: Grace Chambers and Leonard Israel.",Facts (correct), Facts,1.0, Facts,1.0, Facts,1.0,Facts,1.0,Facts,1.0, Facts,1.0,Facts,1.0,Facts,1.0,Facts,1.0, Facts,1.0,Facts,1.0,Facts,1.0, Facts,1.0, Rule,0.0, Facts,1.0, Analysis ,0.0,Facts,1.0,Facts,1.0, Facts,1.0,Facts,1.0,Facts,1.0, Facts,1.0, Facts,1.0, Facts,1.0,Factual History,0.0, Procedural History,0.0,Facts,1.0, Procedural History,0.0, Facts,1.0,Facts,1.0,0.3790490217894517,Low

To ensure that a product launch coincided with Milton Bradley's 1960 centennial, they rushed to produce a prototype in just a few weeks. Markham and Klamer together contributed key features of the game: play would advance along a track winding through a three-dimensional game board, with a spinner determining how far players would move on each turn (thereby *78 progressing through various “life milestones”). Klamer visited Markham's firm once or twice per week to offer feedback on the development of the physical game board and the box cover. Chambers built most of the prototype board. She constructed houses, mountains, and the elevated track out of balsa wood, cardboard, and paper. Israel focused on the art for the prototype's box cover. He produced various sketches, Markham and Klamer chose the one they liked best, and Chambers integrated it into a box cover. As the game took shape, Markham, Klamer, Chambers, and Israel would all play the prototype together, suggesting (and vetoing) various rules and refinements.

In exchange, Link Research would receive a six percent royalty on sales, including a $5,000 non-refundable advance. The second was an assignment agreement between Link Research and Markham. Stating that Markham had “invented, designed[,] and developed [the] game,” it assigned “all of [Markham's] right, title[,] and interest in and to the Game[ ] to LINK.” In exchange, it gave Markham thirty percent of Link Research's six percent royalty, including a $773.05 non-refundable advance.

Conditioning a foreign state's exercise of treaty rights on submitting to the jurisdiction of United States courts could imperil the spirit of cooperation and comity underpinning that regime. In that context, there is good reason to doubt that a foreign state's effort to exercise its agreed-upon treaty rights exhibits an intent to relinquish its immunity from suit. And were we to find that a foreign state's extradition request implies a waiver of immunity in United States courts, we might expect that, as a reciprocal matter, the United States would subject itself to suit in foreign proceedings whenever it requests extradition assistance.

As noted by Commissioner Jordan in her dissent, “the Secretary does not factor the issuance of a section 103(k) order into any of the progressive enforcement mechanisms under the Mine Act ... [and] the issuance of such an order is not considered in a mine's history of violations for purposes of MSHA's future proposed penalty assessments.” M-Class Mining, LLC, 42 FMSHRC at 509 (Jordan, dissenting) (citing 30 U.S.C. §§ 814(e), 820 (Sections 104 and 110, respectively)). Section 110 provides penalties for violations of “mandatory health or safety standard[s]” or “any other provision of this chapter,” 30 U.S.C. § 820(a)(1), but makes specific reference to a penalty for a violation of Section 103(j)  *23  **395 only—requiring timely notification to the Secretary within 15 minutes of a death or injury or entrapment that “has a reasonable potential to cause death” at the mine, id. § 813(j). There might be a penalty under § 110 if a mine operator violated an active safety order under § 103(k)—for example, if M-Class had resumed mine operations in the closed area before the MSHA Inspector had issued the first modification—but there is no basis to impose a penalty based on a terminated safety order under § 103(k). Section 104(e), governing a pattern of violations, is even more limited to “a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards in the coal or other mine which are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of coal or other mine health or safety hazards.” Id. § 814(e)(1).

178,id261,"Text: “The Game of Life” is a classic family board game, introduced in 1960 by the Milton Bradley Company to great success. This case involves a long-running dispute between Rueben Klamer, a toy developer who came up with the initial concept of the game, and Bill Markham, a game designer whom Klamer approached to design and create the actual game prototype. Eventually, their dispute (which now involves various assignees, heirs, and successors-in-interest) reduced to one primary issue: whether the game qualified as a “work for hire” under the Copyright Act of 1909. If it did, Markham's successors-in-interest would not possess the termination rights that would allow them to reassert control over the copyright in the game.

The district court appointed counsel for Lawrence, and counsel filed a supplemental motion explaining that, in light of the Fair Sentencing Act's amended sentencing ranges, Lawrence's conviction now subjected him only to a 0-to-20-year sentencing range rather than the 5-to-40-year range applied at his original sentencing. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B), (C). The supplemental motion also recalculated Lawrence's Guidelines range as 210 to 262 months of imprisonment. In addition, Lawrence argued that time served would be an appropriate reduced sentence given his age (50 years old), consistent with the sentencing factors outlined at 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).
