499,id2944,"Passage: Jenna Boyd was born in Bedford, Texas and moved with her parents and younger brother Cayden (also an actor) to Los Angeles to pursue her acting career. After a few small roles on television and film, Boyd's big break came when she was cast in The Missing, alongside Cate Blanchett and Evan Rachel Wood. Boyd's performance was praised in critical reviews of this film, although the film itself was not particularly well received. Previously she had been in Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star playing the daughter of a family hired by the title character (David Spade) to help him recapture his childhood. In 2005 Boyd played the Leukemia-suffering Bailey Graffman in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Her recent roles include the Lifetime miniseries The Gathering in which she played the daughter of a doctor (Peter Gallagher) searching for his wife and in the Ghost Whisperer episode ""Children of Ghosts"" she played a troubled teenager living in a foster home. In 2017, she played Paige Hardaway, the ""practice girlfriend"" of the autistic main character, Sam Gardener, in the Netflix Original Series Atypical.

Woods has won 79 official PGA Tour events, second only to Sam Snead, and six ahead of Jack Nicklaus with 73 wins. (See List of golfers with most PGA Tour wins.)
Woods has won 14 majors, second all time, behind Jack Nicklaus.
Woods is 14–1 when going into the final round of a major with at least a share of the lead.
Woods scoring average in 2000 is the lowest in PGA Tour history, both adjusted, 67.79, and unadjusted, 68.17.[1]
Woods has the lowest career scoring average in PGA Tour history.
Woods has amassed the most career earnings of any player in PGA Tour history (even after inflation is considered).
Woods is one of five players (along with Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, and Jack Nicklaus) to have won all four professional major championships in his career, known as the Career Grand Slam, and was the youngest to do so.[2]
Woods is the only player to have won all four professional major championships in a row, accomplishing the feat in the 2000–2001 seasons. This feat became known as the ""Tiger Slam"".
Woods set the all-time PGA Tour record for most consecutive cuts made, with 142. The streak started in 1998, he set the record at the 2003 Tour Championship with 114 (passing Byron Nelson's previous record of 113 and Jack Nicklaus at 105) and extended this mark to 142 before it ended on May 13, 2005 at the EDS Byron Nelson Championship. Many consider this to be one of the most remarkable golf accomplishments of all time, given the margin by which he broke the old record and given that during the streak, the next longest streak by any other player was usually only in the 10s or 20s.[3][4][5][6] It should be noted that when Byron Nelson played far fewer players made the cut in a given event.[citation needed]
Woods has won a record 25.2% (79 out of 313) of his professional starts on the PGA Tour.
Woods is the only golfer to have won the U.S. Amateur three consecutive times (1994–96).

602,id3334,"Passage: Full-scale war broke out between the Việt Minh and France in late 1946 and the First Indochina War officially began. Realizing that colonialism was coming to an end worldwide, France decided to bring former emperor Bảo Đại back to power, as a political alternative to Ho Chi Minh. A Provisional Central Government was formed in 1948, reuniting Annam and Tonkin, but the complete reunification of Vietnam was delayed for a year because of the problems posed by Cochinchina's legal status. In July 1949, the State of Vietnam was officially proclaimed, as a semi-independent country within the French Union, with Bảo Đại as Head of State. France was finally persuaded to relinquish its colonies in Indochina in 1954 when Viet Minh forces defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu. The 1954 Geneva Conference left Vietnam a divided nation, with Hồ Chí Minh's communist DRV government ruling the North from Hanoi and Ngô Đình Diệm's Republic of Vietnam, supported by the United States, ruling the South from Saigon. Between 1953 and 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms, including ""rent reduction"" and ""land reform"", which resulted in significant political oppression. During the land reform, testimony from North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents, which extrapolated nationwide would indicate nearly 100,000 executions. Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the Red River Delta area, a lower estimate of 50,000 executions became widely accepted by scholars at the time.[32][33][34][35] However, declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time, although likely greater than 13,500.[36] In the South, Diem went about crushing political and religious opposition, imprisoning or killing tens of thousands.[37]

God gave Sarai the new name ""Sarah"", and blessed her.[15] Abraham was given assurance that Sarah would have a son. Not long afterwards, Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men. One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said, and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child, for her age was as nothing to God. Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, at the very time which had been spoken. The patriarch, then a hundred years old, named the child ""Isaac"" (Hebrew yitschaq, ""laughter"") and circumcised him when he was eight days old.[16] For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, ""God had made me to laugh, [so that] all that hear will laugh with me.""[17] Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. It was during this banquet that Sarah happened upon the then teenaged Ishmael mocking[18] and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and Hagar be removed from their company.[19] Abraham was initially distressed by this but relented when told by God to do as his wife had asked.[20]

592,id33,"Passage: Spike, occasionally referred to as Butch or Killer, is a stern but occasionally dumb American bulldog who is particularly disapproving of cats, but a softie when it comes to mice (though in his debut appearance, Dog Trouble, Spike goes after both Tom and Jerry), and later, his son Tyke. In the shorts Jerry would often try to get Tom in trouble with Spike making him a shoo-in for a beating from the bulldog. Spike has a few weaknesses that Tom tries to capitalize upon: his possessiveness about his bone and his ticklishness. He made his first appearance in the 1942 Tom and Jerry cartoon Dog Trouble, and his first speaking role was in 1944's The Bodyguard, where he was voiced by Billy Bletcher up until 1949, from which point he was voiced by Daws Butler. Unlike his father Spike, Tyke does not speak. He only communicates by yapping, whimpering, growling, facial expressions and wagging his tail. In Tom and Jerry Kids, Tyke does have a speaking role in the program and is the first time that viewers were able to hear Tyke speak. Spike is very protective towards his son and gets very angry at Tom if Tyke is bothered or harmed. Although Tyke has spoken in Tom and Jerry Kids, he has laughed in one Tom and Jerry short. After Daws Butler, Maurice LaMarche, Frank Welker, John DiMaggio, Michael Donovan, Phil LaMarr and currently Rick Zieff would all perform Spike's voice. Tyke's vocal effects are provided by Frank Welker and speaking roles by Patric Zimmerman.

Teams finishing 6-6 with one win against a team from the lower Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), regardless of whether that FCS school meets NCAA scholarship requirements. Until now, an FCS win counted only if that opponent met the scholarship requirements—specifically, that school had to award at least 90% of the FCS maximum of 63 scholarship equivalents over a two-year period. In the 2012 season, programs in four FCS conferences cannot meet the 90% requirement (56.7 equivalents)—the Ivy League, which prohibits all athletic scholarships; the Pioneer Football League and Georgetown, which do not currently award football scholarships; and the Northeast Conference, which limits football scholarships to 38 equivalents.
6-6 teams with two wins over FCS schools.
Teams that finish 6-7 with loss number seven in their conference championship game (that has been eliminated by the conference championship waiver rule).
6-7 teams that normally play a 13-team schedule, such as Hawaii's home opponents. Although Hawaii normally plays a 13-game schedule, it only played 12 games in the 2012 season.
FCS teams who are in the final year of the two-year FBS transition process, if they have at least a 6-6 record.
Finally, 5-7 teams that have a top-5 Academic Progress Rate (APR) score. This was later adjusted to allow other 5-7 teams to be selected thereafter—in order of their APR.[9]

After reading a newspaper story about a beauty queen who died of a drug overdose, Bill views the body at the morgue and identifies it as Mandy. Bill is summoned to Ziegler's house, where he is confronted with the events of the past night and day. Ziegler was one of those involved with the ritual orgy, and identified Bill and his connection with Nick. Ziegler claims that he had Bill followed for his own protection, and that the warnings made against Bill by the society are only intended to scare him from speaking about the orgy. However, he implies the society is capable of acting on their threats. Bill asks about the death of Mandy, whom Ziegler has identified as the masked woman at the party who'd ""sacrificed"" herself to prevent Bill's punishment, and about the disappearance of Nick, the piano player. Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at his home in Seattle. Ziegler also says the ""punishment"" was a charade by the secret society to further frighten Bill, and it had nothing to do with Mandy's death; she was a hooker and addict and had died from another accidental drug overdose. Bill does not know if Ziegler is telling him the truth about Nick's disappearance or Mandy's death, but he says nothing further. When he returns home, Bill finds the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife. He breaks down in tears and decides to tell Alice the whole truth of the past two days.

278,id2004,"Passage: The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Thomas Edison.[1][2][3][4] While other inventors had produced devices that could record sounds, Edison's phonograph was the first to be able to reproduce the recorded sound. His phonograph originally recorded sound onto a tinfoil sheet wrapped around a rotating cylinder. A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill-and-dale groove in the foil. Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone, including the use of wax-coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record. In the 1890s, Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center, coining the term gramophone for disc record players, which is predominantly used in many languages. Later improvements through the years included modifications to the turntable and its drive system, the stylus or needle, and the sound and equalization systems.

He followed her case until she died in 1906, when he first reported publicly on it.[222] During the next five years, eleven similar cases were reported in the medical literature, some of them already using the term Alzheimer's disease.[18] The disease was first described as a distinctive disease by Emil Kraepelin after suppressing some of the clinical (delusions and hallucinations) and pathological features (arteriosclerotic changes) contained in the original report of Auguste D.[223] He included Alzheimer's disease, also named presenile dementia by Kraepelin, as a subtype of senile dementia in the eighth edition of his Textbook of Psychiatry, published on 15 July, 1910.[224]

881,id541,"Passage: ""A rose by any other name would smell as sweet"" is a popular reference to William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, in which Juliet seems to argue that it does not matter that Romeo is from her family's rival house of Montague, that is, that he is named ""Montague"". The reference is often used to imply that the names of things do not affect what they really are. This formulation is, however, a paraphrase of Shakespeare's actual language. Juliet compares Romeo to a rose saying that if he was not named Romeo he would still be handsome and be Juliet's love. This states that if he was not Romeo, then he would not be a Montague and she would be able to get married with no problem at all.

However, twelve members could not attend, eleven of them trapped in besieged Jerusalem and one abroad. The remaining 25 signatories present were called up in alphabetical order to sign, leaving spaces for those absent. Although a space was left for him between the signatures of Eliyahu Dobkin and Meir Vilner, Zerach Warhaftig signed at the top of the next column, leading to speculation that Vilner's name had been left alone to isolate him, or to stress that even a communist agreed with the declaration.[15] However, Warhaftig later denied this, stating that a space had been left for him (as he was one of the signatories trapped in Jerusalem) where a Hebraicised form of his name would have fitted alphabetically, but he insisted on signing under his actual name so as to honour his father's memory and so moved down two spaces. He and Vilner would be the last surviving signatories, and remained close for the rest of their lives. Of the signatories, two were women (Golda Meir (Meyerson/Myerson) and Rachel Cohen-Kagan).[18]

819,id4160,"Passage: A typical explanation found in the scientific literature for the evolution of light hair is related to the evolution of light skin, and in turn the requirement for vitamin D synthesis and northern Europe's seasonal less solar radiation.[30] Lighter skin is due to a low concentration in pigmentation, thus allowing more sunlight to trigger the production of vitamin D. In this way, high frequencies of light hair in northern latitudes are a result of the light skin adaptation to lower levels of solar radiation, which reduces the prevalence of rickets caused by vitamin D deficiency. The darker pigmentation at higher latitudes in certain ethnic groups such as the Inuit is explained by a greater proportion of seafood in their diet and by the climate which they live in, because in the polar climate there is more ice or snow on the ground, and this reflects the solar radiation onto the skin, making this environment lack the conditions for the person to have blond, brown or red hair, light skin and blue, grey or green eyes.

Ten years passed before the $2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design. Two-dollar bills are seldom seen in circulation as a result of banking policies with businesses which has resulted in low production numbers due to lack of demand.

114,id1378,"Passage: Set and filmed in New York City and based on the 1997 book of the same name by Candace Bushnell, the show follows the lives of a group of four women—three in their mid-thirties and one in her forties—who, despite their different natures and ever-changing sex lives, remain inseparable and confide in each other. Starring Sarah Jessica Parker (as Carrie Bradshaw), Kim Cattrall (as Samantha Jones), Kristin Davis (as Charlotte York), and Cynthia Nixon (as Miranda Hobbes), the quirky series had multiple continuing storylines that tackled relevant and modern social issues such as sexuality, safe sex, promiscuity, and femininity, while exploring the difference between friendships and romantic relationships. The deliberate omission of the better part of the early lives of the four women was the writers' way of exploring social life – from sex to relationships – through each of their four very different, individual perspectives.

Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier Elizabethan play known today as the Ur-Hamlet, though some scholars believe he himself wrote the Ur-Hamlet, later revising it to create the version of Hamlet we now have. He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor, Richard Burbage, the leading tragedian of Shakespeare's time. In the 400 years since its inception, the role has been performed by numerous highly acclaimed actors in each successive century.

From then until the completion of the Washington Monument (capped in 1884) the world's tallest buildings were churches or cathedrals.

318,id2166,"Passage: Career records for batting average are usually subject to a minimum qualification of 20 innings played or completed, in order to exclude batsmen who have not played enough games for their skill to be reliably assessed. Under this qualification, the highest Test batting average belongs to Australia's Sir Donald Bradman, with 99.94. Given that a career batting average over 50 is exceptional, and that only five other players have averages over 60, this is an outstanding statistic. The fact that Bradman's average is so far above that of any other cricketer has led several statisticians to argue that, statistically at least, he was the greatest athlete in any sport.[3]

994,id972,"Passage: According to the Origination Clause of the United States Constitution, all bills for raising revenue, generally tax bills, must originate in the House of Representatives, similar to the Westminster system requirement that all money bills originate in the lower house. Traditionally, though, appropriation bills also originate in the House of Representatives.[5][6] House appropriations bills begin with ""H.R."", meaning ""House of Representatives"". In reference to revenue bills, the Constitution also states that the ""Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills."" As with revenue bills, the Senate and House each drafts and considers its own appropriation bill. The Senate then ""cuts-and-pastes,"" substituting the language of its version of a particular appropriation bill for the language of the House bill, then agrees to the bill as amended.

508,id2986,"Passage: ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" (German pronunciation: [ˈʔɪç ˈbɪn ʔaɪn bɛɐ̯ˈliːnɐ], ""I am a Berliner"") is a quotation from a June 26, 1963, speech by U.S. President John F. Kennedy in West Berlin. It is widely regarded as the best-known speech of the Cold War and the most famous anti-communist speech. Kennedy aimed to underline the support of the United States for West Germany 22 months after Soviet-supported East Germany erected the Berlin Wall to prevent mass emigration to the West. The message was aimed as much at the Soviets as it was at Berliners and was a clear statement of U.S. policy in the wake of the construction of the Berlin Wall. Another phrase in the speech was also spoken in German, ""Lasst sie nach Berlin kommen"" (""Let them come to Berlin""), addressed at those who claimed ""we can work with the Communists"", a remark at which Nikita Khrushchev scoffed only days later.

Upon their reunion, Sam reveals that he has been back this whole time searching for whatever force brought him back and hunting with his mother's side of the family, the Campbells, led by their grandfather Samuel who was also resurrected.[46] While hunting with Sam again, Dean quickly notices how different he acts. These include using a baby as bait, allowing a child to go through a torturous treatment to gain information, and allowing Dean to become a vampire.[47][48][49] After facing the goddess Veritas, Dean and Castiel question Sam's behavior. Castiel then reveals that Sam's soul is not with him and is still trapped in Lucifer's Cage.[50][51] It is revealed that Crowley brought back Samuel so that they could help him find Purgatory, the afterlife of monsters, and that Samuel has been working for him. Crowley then states that if Sam and Dean help him he will return Sam's soul, but if they do not help him he will send Sam back to Hell.[51][52] Although Sam still retains his memories, likes, dislikes, and is capable of making rational decisions, he is completely without emotion and appears almost inhuman.[50][52]

383,id2442,"Passage: In music, serialism  is a method of composition using series of pitches, rhythms, dynamics, timbres or other musical elements. Serialism began primarily with Arnold Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique, though some of his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as a form of post-tonal thinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's melody, harmony, structural progressions, and variations. Other types of serialism also work with sets, collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called ""parameters""), such as duration, dynamics, and timbre.

876,id525,"Passage: In meteorology, precipitation is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls under gravity.[2] The main forms of precipitation include drizzle, rain, sleet, snow, graupel and hail. Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor, so that the water condenses and ""precipitates"". Thus, fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions, because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate. Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming saturated: cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air. Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud. Short, intense periods of rain in scattered locations are called ""showers.""[3]

Wavelength is inversely proportional to the wave frequency,[5] so gamma rays have very short wavelengths that are fractions of the size of atoms, whereas wavelengths on the opposite end of the spectrum can be as long as the universe. Photon energy is directly proportional to the wave frequency, so gamma ray photons have the highest energy (around a billion electron volts), while radio wave photons have very low energy (around a femtoelectronvolt).

845,id4278,"Passage: Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centres that contain green chlorophyll pigments. In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that act as an immediate energy storage means: reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the ""energy currency"" of cells.

462,id2772,"Passage: The vacuum flask consists of two flasks, placed one within the other and joined at the neck. The gap between the two flasks is partially evacuated of air, creating a partial-vacuum which reduces heat conduction or convection. Heat transfer by thermal radiation may be minimized by silvering flask surfaces facing the gap but can become problematic if the flask's contents or surroundings are very hot; hence vacuum flasks usually hold contents below the boiling point of water. Most heat transfer occurs through the neck and opening of the flask, where there is no vacuum. Vacuum flasks are usually made of metal, borosilicate glass, foam or plastic and have their opening stoppered with cork or polyethylene plastic. Vacuum flasks are often used as insulated shipping containers.

Meanwhile, Farkle continues to be frustrated with Riley for not telling Lucas how she truly feels about him; Farkle gives her until midnight on New Year's Eve to do so, or he will. During his class, Cory teaches the importance of friendship and growth, and how without proper care, feelings can ruin them. At the party, Charlie and the group play a couples game, in which Maya and Lucas are partners. Riley, Maya, and Lucas become uncomfortable as the game progresses. Riley ends the game on her turn and brings everyone up to the roof, minutes before the new year begins. On the rooftop, Riley asks Farkle for more time to confess her true feelings, but he refuses as he does not want lies to cause further damage. Wanting to be with Riley at midnight, Charlie tries to show he cares about her. Riley tells him while that makes sense, a good relationship needs to have sensibility as well, leaving the two alone on separate sides of the roof. Maya, still confused about her feelings, tells Lucas that she wants to start off the new year being nice to him and that she is glad they will be together at midnight. He grins and says that makes up for everything. When the clock strikes midnight, Riley tries to escape just as Farkle yells out the truth, causing Maya and Lucas to be dismayed by the revelation. Everyone leaves except for Riley, Maya, and Lucas. The three sit alone on a bench, confused.

For the mid-term science experiment, Mr. Norton has Riley and her classmates examine a solution by placing a mystery marble into clear liquid, with one person of each boy-girl team dropping the marble and the other working out the scientific calculations. When Riley sees it is only the girls who are putting the marbles into the liquid and leaving the boys to do the science, she is offended and refuses to follow that trend. She gathers the girls into her bedroom to discuss why this is happening, and makes them realize they are not seeing their potential. She also confronts Farkle, her science experiment partner, about his perceived stereotyping of girls; he takes the blame and apologizes to Riley for not allowing her to pursue her interest in science. While the marble-liquid solution is simply sludge, there is a bigger picture to the experiment which Riley has already figured out. She presents her finding to Mr. Norton, who informs the class it is at their age that girls begin to lose interest in the STEM subjects. The rest of the class cannot see their partners due to the beaker of sludge in their way, but Riley and Farkle can see each other crystal clear, because they worked together equally to complete the science.

As Cory teaches his class about the value of money, and Stuart makes a risky investment on new technology for Minkus International, Farkle becomes concerned about being poor. He quickly starts seeing there is greater value to his friendships and family than money and material things can give. Cory goes further into his money lesson by emphasizing there is a large part of the world that is less fortunate, revealing a greater ""secret of life"": kindness and charity toward others. Cory challenges the class to come up with ideas for using money to help those in need, but this prompts Farkle to leave class immediately and to talk to his father about their relationship and his company's purpose, saying he needs to do more for the rest of the world. Because of the heartfelt conversation, Stuart begins a charitable organization and looks to give away money for a charitable cause. With help from NBA owner Mark Cuban, Stuart, Cory and Topanga listen to Riley, Lucas, Maya and Farkle about how they would help the less fortunate. Ultimately, on Farkle's request, Stuart and Mark invest on Maya, who lives in need and appreciates all she has been given. Meanwhile, Auggie worries about his father when he does not receive his whole allowance, but learns the importance of Cory's contributions as a teacher, despite being paid less than Topanga.

Riley and Lucas are two members on the school honor board, which is to decide a case involving Maya and Farkle. Riley, who finds out Maya cheated off Farkle on a test, wants them off the hook for the sake of their friendship, but Lucas disagrees, as does Cory, who oversees the honor board. When Cory's class learns about communism, Riley defends Maya's cheating as a form of sharing and feels there is nothing wrong with what she did. The girls and Farkle start embracing the ideals of communism, and disregard their individuality. As Maya and Farkle's fate is being determined by the honor board, Riley sides with them, and Topanga represents them, but it is revealed that Farkle was not the only one helping Maya to cheat, but Riley as well. After Cory hands back a test where everyone has received excellent scores, but Riley, Maya and Farkle end up with an ""average"" grade, the three realize the importance of being individuals. Meanwhile, Auggie is wondering what to do with his life, but things backfire when he decides to be a lawyer and defend Frankie, the class bully.

Riley and Maya have not discussed their feelings for Lucas since the new year, so he decides to simply stay friends with them for the sake of not hurting either girl. As Cory teaches his class one last time, the group feels that Cory has not given them enough instruction to move forward to high school. Cory admits to being wrong about not allowing them to feel as a natural part of their changing, but sees how much his class has learned while in middle school. For the final lesson, he challenges them to leave a lasting mark for future John Quincy Adams students to remember them by, prompting them to dedicate a new bench in the school hallway. As they graduate and leave middle school behind, they decide for their class prank to steal their school mascot, which shocks Cory. It turns out it is Cory. Through Riley's call to Superintendent Turner and a heavily-supported petition, Cory is allowed to transfer schools so he can continue to teach Riley and her friends in high school.

850,id429,"Passage: Season Three opens with Payson, Lauren, and Kaylie heading to the American Olympic Training Center as they prepare for the 2012 London Olympics. They deal with a new coach and teammates, including upcoming gymnasts. Max and Payson have a relationship through letters; on the first day Payson receives a letter in which Max breaks up with her because he's confused. Later Payson, Lauren, Kaylie, and Austin are having a conversation based around the breakup and Austin admits to the group that Max was bisexual and that they shared a kiss on the night of the party which leaves all three girls stunned. An uninvited gymnast, Jordan Randall, convinces Coach MacIntire to let her train with the group, causing tension. Coach Mac pairs up the girls, forcing Kaylie to live and work with Kelly Parker and Lauren to work with Payson. They eventually become close friends. Kelly is not good enough for the Olympics and leaves gymnastics. Payson has a new romance with Rigo (Tom Maden). Payson finds out that Lauren has an irregular heart beat, but Lauren has heart surgery. Austin does not make the Olympic Team and blames Kaylie. Jordan reveals that a former coach, Coach Keagan, molested her when she was young. Desperate to ensure her spot on the team, Wendy drugs Kaylie with a cold medicine containing a banned substance. After Austin and Kaylie reunite, then Lauren, Payson, and Jordan tell the NGO that they are boycotting Olympic tryouts unless Kaylie is allowed to perform. Lauren discovers the secret Wendy has been hiding and exposes her, getting Wendy kicked out. The season three finale culminates with the five girls, Payson, Lauren, Kaylie, plus Jordan, and finally Colleen, being chosen to represent the U.S. in the Olympics.

These cells have special molecules that allow them to move iron into the body. To be absorbed, dietary iron can be absorbed as part of a protein such as heme protein or iron must be in its ferrous Fe2+ form. A ferric reductase enzyme on the enterocytes’ brush border, duodenal cytochrome B (Dcytb), reduces ferric Fe3+ to Fe2+.[9] A protein called divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), which can transport several divalent metals across the plasma membrane, then transports iron across the enterocyte’s cell membrane into the cell.

For over a century, humans have been living in settlements surrounded by three gigantic walls, which prevent the Titans, giant humanoid creatures who eat humans, from entering. Eren Jaeger, of the town called the Shiganshina District, wishes to see the outside world by joining the Scout Regiment, as he likens living in the cities to livestock. Despite this, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackermann and their mother Carla Jaeger are against him joining the Scouts. Even after seeing the Scouts return home with large casualties, Eren expresses his interest to join, which impresses his father Grisha Jaeger. After Eren and Mikasa rescue their friend Armin Arlelt from a group of delinquents due to his views that the walls will not protect them forever, the Colossal Titan suddenly appears and knocks down the gate to the Shiganshina District, which lies in the outer edge of Wall Maria, allowing smaller Titans to enter. As the town erupts into mass panic, Eren and Mikasa rush back to Carla, only to see her pinned under their collapsed house. Carla begs them to flee, but they refuse until city guard Hannes arrives and takes them away. Eren watches in horror as a Smiling Titan eats Carla.

Hannes apologizes to Eren for not saving his mother, admitting he was afraid of the Smiling Titan and that both Eren and Mikasa are still weak children. Some of townsfolk of the Shiganshina District escape to the inner Wall Maria, while the soldiers try to hold off the Titans. The soldiers try to close the gate, but the Armored Titan rams the gate, breaching the inner Wall Maria, and causing those inside to retreat even further inside Wall Rose. Some time later, Eren has a strange dream in which his grieving father forcefully gives him an injection and his key before being woken up by Mikasa. Eren grows disgusted with the people of Wall Rose as the latter do not like sharing their food or homes with the refugees. During the next year, as a food shortage becomes apparent, the government orders the refugees to either work on the farms or fight to reclaim Wall Maria. About 250,000 people, 20% of the populace, choose to fight, only to be wiped out by the Titans. Eren vows revenge and joins the army along with Mikasa and Armin.

The drill instructor Keith Sadies inspects the new recruits of the 104th Cadet Corps and provides a barrage of verbal insults. When he comes across Sasha Braus, who is eating a potato, he punishes her by having her run around the camp until sunset and not giving her any food or drink. Eren develops a rivalry with Jean Kirschtein, who desires a safe and easy position in the Military Police Regiment within the inner city walls. The recruits train on an omni-directional mobility gear[1] apparatus, where they have to balance themselves while suspended on cables. After Eren has trouble balancing, he asks Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover for help and discover they too are among the few who have personally encountered Titans. The next day, Eren balances on the apparatus but falls, but Keith discovers that Eren's apparatus was defective and passes him after a retry with different equipment.

Five years since Wall Maria fell, Keith evaluates the recruits for their strengths and weaknesses. After training in hand-to-hand combat with Reiner and Annie Leonhart, Eren learns later that night that Jean and several other recruits hope to join the Military Police Regiment to avoid having to fight Titans. On graduation day, Eren and Mikasa rank among the top ten of their class. They are eligible to join the Military Police Regiment, but Eren declines and announces that he is joining the Scout Regiment on the front lines, leading Armin and Mikasa to join him. They are assigned to the Trost District, one of the cities which is at the outer edge of Wall Rose, where they discover other classmates have joined. The Colossal Titan appears and breaches the gate. Once Eren regains his composure, he takes command and orders a counterattack.

The Colossal Titan destroys the wall's cannons, but it vanishes into a burst of stream before Eren prepares to attack its weak point. The Military Police Regiment scrambles to evacuate the people of the Trost District and set up defenses before the Titans enter the city. Assigned by Commander Kitts Woerman of the Garrison Regiment to different squads, Mikasa helps with the evacuation, while Eren and Armin provide backup at the front lines. With the Titans now in the city, Eren recalls his lessons that in order to kill a Titan, they must strike the nape of its neck. As Eren and Armin's squad attack, their comrades are killed or eaten by the Titans one by one, with Eren himself losing his left leg. Armin, paralyzed with fear upon seeing his comrades' fates, is picked up by a Bearded Titan and almost swallowed. Eren, recalling when he and Armin wished to see the world outside the walls, manages to drag and toss Armin out of the Bearded Titan's mouth at the last moment. He reaches for Armin with his left arm out of the Bearded Titan's mouth, but the Bearded Titan closes its jaws, severing Eren's arm and swallowing him.

Armin awakens to find himself surrounded by Conny Springer, Christa Lenz and Ymir. As Armin heads back to the rearguard, he blames himself not being strong enough to save Eren. Meanwhile, an Abnormal Titan approaches the city's exit gate, which is crowded by refugees. Once Mikasa kills the Abnormal Titan, she threatens a greedy merchant holding cargo to let the refugees pass first. After she is thanked by a mother and daughter, Mikasa has a flashback. In the year 844, a year before the fall of Wall Maria, Mikasa was targeted by three slave traders, who murdered her parents in a struggle. After Grisha and Eren discovered the corpses while making a visit, Eren secretly tracked down the slave traders to a nearby hut and killed two of them in an attempt to save Mikasa. However, the third slave trader appeared and began strangling Eren. Encouraged by Eren, Mikasa overcame her fear and gained resolve to kill the third slave trader. After the children are found by the Military Police Regiment, Mikasa was invited to live with Eren and Grisha. Back in the present, Mikasa slays more Titans and goes to help the other squads evacuate.

The surviving squads, unable to reach the inner walls due to their omni-directional mobility gear being low on gas, lose their fighting spirit as the nearby supply depot is overrun by Titans. Mikasa seems unfazed after learning from Armin that his entire squad perished, including Eren. She rallies the others to reclaim the supply depot, inspiring them to join her in the attack, but Mikasa ends up running out of gas midair and falls into an alleyway. Jean assumes command, but he loses his nerve when he sees some of his comrades being eaten by Titans. As a blonde Titan approaches Mikasa, she prepares to attack with her remaining broken blade, but a Mysterious Titan appears behind her and brutally kills the blonde Titan, much to her confusion. Armin and Conny show up, shocked to witness the Mysterious Titan not only fighting other Titans, but also showing knowledge of their weak point and using hand-to-hand combat techniques, while completely ignoring the humans. Armin gives Mikasa his gas tanks and blades so that she can support the others at the supply depot. Mikasa, however, refuses to leave him behind and ponders on the Mysterious Titan's strange behavior.

With the supply depot swarming with Titans, Armin has the idea of using the Mysterious Titan to defeat them. Mikasa and Conny agree with his plan and defeat the Titans attacking it, before rushing to the supply depot. Meanwhile, Jean and the others reach the supply depot despite suffering more casualties on the way, with Armin, Mikasa and Conny arriving soon after. Armin's plan works, but while the Mysterious Titan is able to attract the enemies outside, seven smaller Titans remain in the fuel storage area. With their equipment out of fuel, Armin devises another plan. The survivors draw the Titans' attention to an elevator and shoot them in the eyes to blind them, while seven of them jump from the ceiling to finish them off. Sasha and Conny fail to kill their targets but are saved by Mikasa and Annie. Having successfully replenished their fuel, the soldiers prepare to retreat. As they see the Mysterious Titan defeating all of the other Titans before collapsing, they are shocked to watch Eren emerge from its body. Mikasa reaches Eren and cries upon confirming that he is alive, while Armin notices that Eren's severed leg and arm have somehow regenerated as well.

Captain Levi of the Scout Regiment and his squad successfully retake a town from the Titans until they are called to an emergency at the Trost District as the Titans have invaded the city. When Eren was eaten and swallowed by the Bearded Titan, he found himself in its stomach along with the bodies of its victims. His rage at the Titans caused him to burst out of the Bearded Titan's stomach by transforming himself into the Mysterious Titan and going on a rampage against them. Although Eren's comrades saw him emerge from the Mysterious Titan, they all agreed to keep it a secret and bring him back inside Wall Rose. However, Kitts also witnessed this and has his men aim their weapons at Eren. Armin and Mikasa try to defend Eren, but to no avail. As Kitts fearfully orders the cannons to fire on the three of them, Eren recalls hazy memories of his father giving him an injection, telling him to reclaim Wall Maria and go to their home's basement with his key. In order to protect Mikasa and Armin from the cannons, Eren partially transforms himself into the Mysterious Titan, sheltering them inside his ribs.

Eren climbs out of the partially transformed Titan, telling Mikasa and Armin about the basement in his former house. He believes that it holds the secret to mankind's preservation and the key to destroying the Titans. Kitts once again orders the cannon to be loaded out of fear. Eren comes up with two plans of escape. The first is for Eren to retreat as the Mysterious Titan and criminalize himself in the eyes of humanity, and the second is to have Armin convince Kitts that Eren is an asset rather than a danger. Armin comes to the conclusion that he can still defend his friends despite being cowardice, deciding to try and talk their way out of being executed. Armin tentatively convinces Kitts, only to have him be overcome by fear and give the order to fire once more. The order is halted when Commander Dot Pyxis and his men intervene, sparing their lives. In return, Pyxis asks Eren if he will transform himself to block the gap in Wall Rose to prevent more Titans from getting in. Eren agrees, regardless of whether or not he will be able to control himself as the Mysterious Titan.

As Armin helps Pyxis's subordinates coordinate a plan, morale among the troops begin to drop, as some want to desert and be with their families. Pyxis silences everyone by reminding them that if they abandon this chance to finally win against the Titans, they will be subjecting their families to their terror, which convinces the troops to stay. Claiming that Eren is the result of a secret project to turn humans into Titans, Pyxis plans to have most of the troops gather at a far corner of the Trost District to lure most of the Titans away while Eren as the Mysterious Titan carries the giant boulder to seal the hole. Along with Mikasa, Eren will be guarded during the mission by three of the best elites of the Garrison, them being Ian Dietrich, Rico Brzenska and Mitabi Jarnach. As they approach the giant boulder, Rico, who is doubtful of the mission's success and does not completely trust Eren, reminds him that many lives are at stake. Finally reaching the boulder, Eren transforms himself into a Titan, only to suddenly attack Mikasa.

Mikasa tries to reason with Eren in as the Mysterious Titan, but to no avail. Eren continues his attack and accidentally incapacitates himself, slumping to the ground. The squad protecting Eren sends up a red flare to signal that the plan has failed, much to the dismay of the troops observing from the wall. As Armin heads toward Eren to investigate, the elite squadron argues and eventually agrees to protect Eren instead of abandoning him, still recognizing him as a valuable military asset. During the operation, Jean is separated from Connie and Annie after his omni-directional mobility gear malfunctions, forcing him to hide from two Titans in a building. Armin reaches the unconscious Eren, but Mikasa calls to him, warning that he is in a dangerous state. Armin plunges his sword into the side of Eren's neck, which briefly awakens him. As Armin speaks to him of the outside world and reminds him of his promise to kill all the Titans, Eren leaves his dreamlike state and regains control.

Jean manages to acquire another set of omni-directional mobility gear from a dead soldier and escapes, thanks to Annie, Conny and Marco Bott distracting the Titans. With Eren as the Mysterious Titan carrying the boulder towards the gate, Ian orders everyone to protect Eren from the Titans at all costs. Eren finally blocks the open gate with the boulder, and Rico fires a yellow flare to signal that the operation was a success. As Armin tries to pull Eren from his Titan body, they are cornered by two Titans, but Levi saves them in the nick of time. All Titans remaining in the Trost Districts are eliminated except two, which are captured for research. Jean, Sasha and Annie all mourn the deaths of their fellow comrades among several casualties. Meanwhile, Eren is chained in a cell guarded by the Military Police Regiment, where he is visited by Levi and Commander Erwin Smith of the Scout Regiment. After listening to his story and reasons for wanting the Titans dead, Levi allows Eren to join his squad under his command, though Eren is warned that Levi would personally kill him if he ever betrays the squad or loses control again.

The populace is divided over whether Eren is their savior or their end. Eren is brought to a military tribunal to be judged by Commander-in-Chief Dhalis Zachary, who will decide whether Eren should be given to the Military Police Regiment or the Scout Regiment, both of whom have their own reasons for wanting him. The Military Police Regiment wants Eren killed as he is seen by them as a menace, while the Scout Regiment wants to use him to retake Wall Maria. Becoming furious upon hearing from a merchant that Mikasa is accused of being a Titan as well, Eren calls out the Military Police Regiment and their supporters for their cowardice. Levi brutally beats down Eren in retaliation, but Eren does not transform into the Mysterious Titan. Levi uses this to show to the court that the Scout Regiment can control Eren, and proposes that Eren is to be made part of his squad. In the end, Zachary gives Eren to the Scout Regiment, where Erwin and Hange Zoë welcome him. As Eren is getting treatment for his wounds, they discover that he grew back a tooth knocked out after being beaten down by Levi.

As Levi orders the castle to be cleaned, Petra assures Eren that Levi does care about the people under his command despite his rude and harsh demeanor. Meanwhile, Erwin and Miche Zacharius discuss the new recruits joining the Scout Regiment and how they must prove Eren's usefulness to Military Command within a month. Hange asks Eren to help her in her experiments with the two Titans they have captured, which she named Sawney and Beane. She has an obsession with Titans where she treats them like people despite the many times she puts herself in danger. It is revealed that the Titans need sunlight to survive and their bodies are disproportionately light despite their size. The next day, the Scout Regiment discover that Sawney and Beane have been killed. As Hange mourns for them, the Scout Regiment deduce that the culprit is a soldier who escaped using their omni-directional mobility gear, which makes Eren wonder who their true enemy is.

The 104th Cadets are later greeted by Erwin at the Decision Ceremony, where he tells them that the goal of the Scout Regiment's expedition on the following month is to reclaim the Shiganshina District and find the secret hidden in Eren's home basement. After telling the recruits of the Scout Regiment's high mortality rate during each expedition, Erwin tells the recruits that they may stay and join them or leave to join the other branches. Most recruits leave, but Jean joins the Scout Regiment in honor of Marco with others joining him as well including Mikasa, Armin, Reiner, Bertholdt, Conny, Sasha, Christa and Ymir, despite their fears. As the Scout Regiment prepare themselves for the expedition, Eren is reunited with his friends and learns what happened to the others. Jean questions whether Eren can truly control his Titan powers as they are risking their lives for him. With everything ready, the Scout Regiment begin their 57th Expedition beyond the walls.

As the 57th Expedition gets underway, the Scout Regiment assemble into their Long-Range Scouting Formation, wherein the Scouts spread out around the main wagon train and report by flare gun if Titans are nearby so the group can steer to avoid conflict with them if possible. After Armin's squad manages to kill an Abnormal Titan, a Female Titan suddenly appears from the right flank at high speed. Much to Armin's shock, the Female Titan's body can withstand their blades and is intelligent enough to kill his seniors easily. The Female Titan captures Armin, but after removing his hood and seeing his face, she leaves him alive and continues running. Armin is picked up by Reiner and Jean, who reveals that their right flank was wiped out by the Titans, which makes Armin realize not only was it the Female Titan's work, but also is she possibly another Titan Shifter like Eren. When the three of them give conflicting sources on where Eren is in the formation, they realize the Female Titan's target is Eren and they must stop her. Despite their failed attempts to attack, she leaves them and heads towards the center group.

They wait for the order to withdraw, but to their surprise, they discover that their operation is continuing albeit heading in a different direction. Meanwhile, news reaches the center group about their right flank being annihilated by the Female Titan as the latter continues to wreak havoc within the formation. The whole formation soon reaches the Forest of Giant Trees with only the center row entering it, while the rest defend the forest from Titans. Eren realizes something is wrong when his squad has no idea what Erwin's orders are and what Levi is doing. As the Female Titan chases them at their heels, the squad desperately await Levi's command to attack, but Levi instead tells his squad to cover their ears as he fires his flare gun.

Levi fires a noise round and tells the squad to keep moving forward. With more of the rearguard getting killed by the Female Titan, Eren begs his squad to let him fight, but they tell him to trust Levi's decision. Eren starts remembering when he was unable to transform into the Mysterious Titan for experimental purposes in front of Hange, Levi and his squad. During a break when he tried to pick up a teaspoon, Eren suddenly partially transformed, leading Hange to deduce that Eren is able to transform into a Titan not by solely injuring himself but also due to his desire to fulfill his goals. The squad apologized to Eren and told him they should trust each other. Remembering this, Eren decides to trust his squad's plan. It is then revealed that Levi's squad is bait to lure the Female Titan into an ambush, where Erwin and his men fire hundreds of grappling hooks to trap the Female Titan. Levi leaves his squad to meet up with Erwin to find out the identity of the Female Titan.

Armin, Jean and the rest of Levi's squad realize it was Erwin's plan to use Eren as bait to draw out the mole within the army who joined them after the Walls fell and only told his real plan to those who were part of the Scout Regiment before the fall. Meanwhile, the others wonder about what is happening inside the forest, and Levi taunts the Female Titan, prompting her to give a loud scream that draws all Titans in the vicinity to her. Despite the Scout Regiment's attempt to stop them, the Titans ignore the humans and eat the Female Titan's body in a frenzy, which makes Erwin call off the expedition. However, knowing that there is no confirmation that the mole has also been eaten by the Titans, Erwin orders Levi to regroup with his squad, while the mole, disguised as a cloaked Scout Regiment member, attacks Levi's squad and kills Günther.

Erwin tells Hange that it was a mistake to think all Titan Shifters are like Eren, since the Female Titan has unique abilities far beyond that of a novice. Elsewhere, the mole transforms into the Female Titan and chases after Levi's squad. Armin theorizes that the mole is someone who had seen Eren transform during the invasion of the Trost District. Eren wants to transform into the Mysterious Titan, but the squad tells him to trust in their skills and keep moving forward. Eld, Oruo and Petra manage to blind the Female Titan and attempt to cut off her arms. However, the Female Titan quickly regenerates her right eye and kills the three. Seeing his comrades dead, a grieving Eren transforms into the Mysterious Titan. Believing his comrades and squad's death could have been avoided if he had transformed in the first place, Eren fights the Female Titan in a long battle. The Female Titan finally defeats Eren by taking off his head and swallowing his human body. Mikasa attempts to stop the Female Titan, but to no avail. She is later joined by Levi, who tells her to keep their distance, as the Female Titan is getting tired.

While Mikasa distracts the Female Titan in order to get Eren back, Levi debilitates the Female Titan at high speeds, but Levi injures his leg when saving Mikasa from leaving herself vulnerable. Mikasa then goes with Levi, who retrieves Eren from inside the mouth of the Female Titan, leaving it badly wounded and slumped against a tree. The Scout Regiment retrieves the corpses of their fallen comrades, with Erwin ordering that the lost corpses be reported missing in action. One their way back into town, the Scouts are chased by two Titans, one of which is killed by Mikasa. They outrun the other Titan after Levi reluctantly orders to dispose some of the corpses in order to lighten the wagon's load. Later, Eren wakes up from a dream of his past and finds himself and the Scout Regiment back at town safely behind Wall Sina. The townspeople not only berate the Scout Regiment's ineptitude, but also become enraged and upset at Erwin over the failure of the mission and the casualties that were sustained. As a result of the failed expedition, Erwin and his subordinates are summoned to the capital, where the final decision of Eren's custody will be made.

Annie's colleagues Hitch Dreyse and Marlo Sand joined the Military Police Regiment for opposite reasons, one for its current corruption and the other its possible reformation. After the convoy has entered the Stohess District, Annie is secretly called by Armin in the alleyways. Armin begs for her help, as he is helping Eren escape the capital, and the one riding in the convoy is actually Jean in disguise. Although declining at first, she finally agrees when Armin believes that she is a good person. Armin leads Eren, Mikasa and Annie to an underground tunnel, but Annie refuses to enter. Armin finally reveals his suspicion that Annie is the Female Titan, noting that she used Marco's omni-directional mobility gear to kill Sawney and Beane and that the Female Titan did not kill him during the 57th Expedition. After Eren and Armin beg Annie to prove them wrong by following them, she laughs and soon transforms using the spike in her ring.

Eren tries to transform but is unable to, and Mikasa suspects that his feelings for Annie are preventing him to do so. When Eren is trapped in another tunnel collapse, Mikasa and Armin distract Annie away from Eren. Meanwhile, Commander Nile Dawk of the Military Police Regiment demands an explanation from Erwin on what is happening as his men hold him at gunpoint. Mikasa and the rest of the Scout Regiment distract and try to capture Annie, while Armin and Jean attempt to free Eren from the rubble. Armin tells Eren that he has to fight Annie as anyone who refuses to sacrifice can never change anything. As Eren thinks about what Armin said, he remembers his hatred for the Smiling Titan who killed his mother. Eren finally transforms into the Mysterious Titan and charges at Annie in a rage, smashing into a cathedral.

Erwin, who accepts responsibility for the damage his plan has caused, is arrested by Nile, who orders the Military Police Regiment to help evacuate the civilians. After exchanging several blows, Annie is overpowered by Eren and attempts to escape by climbing up Wall Sina, but Mikasa cuts off Annie's fingers and sends her falling. Eren prepares to eat Annie, but he stops when she starts to cry. Her body starts encasing itself in crystal before he recuperates in human form. Erwin attends a government inquiry to clear his name, explaining that he kept his plans secret to prevent leaks, despite the casualties during his plans. His new plan is to find Titan Shifters and use them to launch a counterattack against the Titans. Eren stays with the Scout Regiment, and Annie is put under the custody of the Scout Regiment. In the epilogue, a piece of Wall Sina crumbles, revealing the face of a Titan within the wall.

However, some body parts may be controlled by partially overlapping regions of cortex. Each cerebral hemisphere of the primary motor cortex only contains a motor representation of the opposite (contralateral) side of the body. The amount of primary motor cortex devoted to a body part is not proportional to the absolute size of the body surface, but, instead, to the relative density of cutaneous motor receptors on said body part. The density of cutaneous motor receptors on the body part is generally indicative of the necessary degree of precision of movement required at that body part. For this reason, the human hands and face have a much larger representation than the legs.

From an economic and practical standpoint however, a patent is better and perhaps more precisely regarded as conferring upon its proprietor ""a right to try to exclude by asserting the patent in court"", for many granted patents turn out to be invalid once their proprietors attempt to assert them in court.[3] A patent is a limited property right the government gives inventors in exchange for their agreement to share details of their inventions with the public.

Its first three articles entrench the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into three branches: the legislative, consisting of the bicameral Congress; the executive, consisting of the President; and the judicial, consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts.

The demo he made for ""Hotel California"" showed influences from Latin and reggae music, and it grabbed the attention of Henley who said he liked the song that ""sounds like a Mexican reggae or Bolero"",[9] which gave the song its first working title, ""Mexican Reggae"".[10]

957,id837,"Passage: Fructose, or fruit sugar, is a simple ketonic monosaccharide found in many plants, where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed directly into blood during digestion. Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847.[4][5]  The name ""fructose"" was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Allen Miller.[6]  Pure, dry fructose is a sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid, and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars.[7]
Fructose is found in honey, tree and vine fruits, flowers, berries, and most root vegetables.

About two thousand Nazis marched to the centre of Munich, where they confronted the police, which resulted in the death of 16 Nazis and four police officers.[1] Hitler was not wounded during the clash, although he locked his left arm with the right arm of Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter who, when he was shot and killed, pulled Hitler to the pavement with him. Hitler escaped immediate arrest and was spirited off to safety in the countryside. After two days, Hitler was arrested and charged with treason.[2]

Her mother died when she was five years old. Her catchphrases during the early seasons of the series include ""how rude!,"" ""well, pin a rose on your nose!"" and ""hot dog"". She eventually evolved into something of a tomboy in seasons four and five. Stephanie has a habit of spying on D.J.'s life by reading her diary and eavesdropping on her telephone calls (having been caught in the act several times), and is generally the most athletic and nosiest of the Tanner girls. Her best friends in school are Gia Mahan and Mickey, whom she meets in season seven (the former is the only one who appears through to season eight). Of the three sisters, Stephanie has dealt with the toughest issues, such as peer pressure into smoking (in season seven's ""Fast Friends""), ""make-out"" parties (in season eight's ""Making Out is Hard to Do""), joyriding (in season eight's ""Stephanie's Wild Ride""), and uncovering a classmate's child abuse (in season six's ""Silence is Not Golden""), as well as the death of her mother when she was only five. In her early years, she is very sentimental about Mr. Bear, a stuffed animal that her mother gave to her after Michelle was born (this was the focal point of the season two episode ""Goodbye Mr. Bear""). She and Jesse are the most abrasive when it comes to how they feel about Kimmy Gibbler.

February 5, 2017
TBA


The Present Zenō-sama and Future Zenō-sama are playing a game together in their realm, but both have become bored with their monotonous routine. Meanwhile, Goku heads to a local farmer's market to sell his produce and get Chi-Chi off his back about making money. On the way home, he is ambushed by some robbers. Goku defeats them, but he is injured in the process. Deciding that he has grown rusty, Goku and Goten decide to train with Whis. They head to the Capsule Corporation building, where Bulma reveals she is pregnant with her and Vegeta's second child. Goten remains behind to train with Trunks. Vegeta declines to accompany Goku so that he can be with Bulma when she gives birth. Goku heads to Beerus' planet alone. While training with Whis, Goku remembers Zenō-sama's intention to hold a multiverse martial arts tournament. Heedless of Beerus and Whis' warnings, Goku uses Zenō-sama's button to head to his realm and convince both Zenō-samas to hold the tournament. When he returns to Beerus' planet, Beerus angrily berates Goku and explains that Zenō-sama's naive and innocent nature combined with his extreme power makes him a danger to the multiverse. Beerus threatens to kill Goku if he steps out of line again. Goku, Beerus, and Whis head to the Sacred World of the Kais, where the Great Priest arrives. He tells the group to assemble their ten most powerful warriors to compete in the ""Tournament of Power"" (力の大会, Chikara no Taikai).

February 12, 2017
TBA


The Great Priest explains the details of the ""Tournament of Power"" and states that it will be held on ""the World of Void"". It is a place of ""infinite nothingness"", where the competitors can fight without limits. The tournament champion will be granted a wish by the Super Dragon Balls, while the losers and their respective universes will be completely erased from existence. Everyone is horrified by this harsh penalty. Goku suggests asking Zenō-sama to ignore it, but Whis advises against this. Whis tells Goku that Zenō-sama has already made up his mind and attempting to change it could be dangerous. Beerus demands that Goku takes responsibility for asking Zenō-sama to hold the tournament in the first place. Goku declares that he will defeat any opponent he faces. The Great Priest also reveals that Universes 7 and 9 are to have a smaller exhibition tournament for Future Zenō-sama's benefit. Each universe is to name three fighters. Goku sets off to recruit teammates. After Vegeta refuses, Goku recruits Gohan and Majin Buu, who is accompanied by Mr. Satan to represent Universe 7. Goku also explains the potential penalty to Gohan. Gohan tells Goku to keep the stakes a secret to prevent mass panic. Back at Zenō-sama's palace, all the gods from all 12 universes gather. The Great Priest explains the purpose of the Zen Exhibition Match. He alludes to the possibility of Zenō-sama erasing the fighters that he deems unfit for the tournament. In the first round, Majin Buu is to fight Basil (バジル, Bajiru), a humanoid canine fighter from Universe 9.

Basil quickly gains the upper hand and beats down Majin Buu, who is not taking the fight seriously and thinks of it as a game. Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu's attention, which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack. As Roh (ロウ, Rō), the Supreme Kai of Universe 9, claims victory, Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach, but he is otherwise unmoved. Basil and Roh are shocked to see this. Mr. Satan is injured during the attack. He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious. This enrages Majin Buu to the point, where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring. However, since neither Zenō-sama is satisfied with the fight, Basil is allowed to get back into the ring. Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful. Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating, Zenō-sama is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue. The Great Priest announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along. Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him, which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9. However, Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil. This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory. As the Universe 9 team laments Basil's loss, Basil's second oldest brother Lavender (ラベンダ, Rabenda) says that if he is allowed to kill his opponent, which Bergamo gives him permission to do, he can win his match. Gohan volunteers to fight Lavender.

TBA


As their battle begins, Lavender spits a poison mist into Gohan's eyes and blinds him. Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison, but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone. Unable to see, Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows. Lavender counters by levitating, which eliminates the sound of his footsteps. Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender's body, which uses it as a kind of active radar. Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan's body. Lavender mounts a comeback. In desperation, Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack. He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed. Lavender is knocked out, but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he cannot continue. With both fighters down, the match is declared a tie. After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean, the Great Priest announces to those in attendance that all universes that lose the Tournament of Power will be erased with their respective gods as well. However, Universes 1, 5, 8, and 12 will be exempt from erasure as will the Angels from all universes because their inhabitants are particularly strong. Zeno-sama had long believed that there were too many universes. He was planning to erase most of them anyway, but the tournament will afford one of the weaker universes the chance to be spared. With the announcement concluded, the ring is repaired in preparation for the final exhibition match where Goku will fight Bergamo (ベルガモ, Berugamo), Basil's oldest brother who is also a humanoid canine.

Before their battle begins, Bergamo denounces Goku before the assembled gods. Bergamo pleads with Zenō-sama to rescind the rule that the universes that lose the Tournament of Power be erased. Zenō-sama agrees on the condition that Bergamo beats Goku in an all out battle. Great Priest states that if Goku holds back to cancel the erasure, Zenō-sama will immediately erase all of the universes. Both Goku and Bergamo agree to the terms. When the fight begins, Bergamo invites Goku to hit him and leaves himself exposed. Goku obliges and strikes Bergamo several times, but Bergamo absorbs the energy of Goku's attacks. He grows stronger and physically larger. Goku continues to attack, which causes Bergamo to grow so large that the ring begins to buckle under his weight. Goku transforms to Super Saiyan Blue, which shocks the gods and quickly overwhelms Bergamo with a Kaioken powered Kamehameha. Bergamo claims every universe participating in the Tournament of Power will seek vengeance on Goku for making them face erasure, but Goku relishes the idea of such a challenge. The Zen Exhibition Match comes to a close and the Tournament of Power will soon begin. The universe with the most fighters remaining or the last fighter standing will be declared the winner. Suddenly, a mysterious fighter from Universe 11 named Toppo (トッポ) appears and challenges Goku to a battle. Goku, who is unsatisfied after his short fight with Bergamo, agrees to fight Toppo.

After obtaining Zenō-sama's blessing to proceed, Goku and Toppo begin their battle. Toppo quickly gains the upper hand and dislocates Goku's shoulder. Goku responds by attacking with a flurry of blows, but Toppo manages to grab Goku in a powerful bear hug. He begins squeezing the life out of Goku, which forces Goku to turn Super Saiyan Blue to escape. Goku gains the upper hand in this form and damages Toppo with a Kamehameha. Just as the two power up even more, the Great Priest puts an end to the fight. As Toppo leaves, he reveals to Goku that Universe 11 has a warrior even stronger than him named Jiren (ジレン). The Great Priest begins creating a martial arts arena suitable for the Tournament of Power. In the Sacred World of the Kais, Beerus and Goku get into an argument over Goku's constant relaxed and negligent attitude, which Whis breaks up. The group agrees to convene at the Capsule Corporation to discuss their future strategy.

Goku and the others arrive at Capsule Corporation. They discuss who should be on the team. Goku immediately suggests Monaka, but Beerus tells him that Monaka is sick and cannot participate. Goku and Gohan agree on Vegeta, Piccolo, Krillin, Master Roshi, No. 18, and No. 17, which would bring the total number of fighters up to nine. Trunks and Goten are ruled out due to their inexperience. They proceed to ask Vegeta, who has been thinking of a name for his second child. Vegeta refuses to participate. He says he will not fight, while Bulma is pregnant. Whis uses his time warping ability to birth the baby sooner than expected in order to get Vegeta to agree to the fight. Everyone celebrates the baby's birth. Trunks is slightly disappointed he has a sister because he wanted to train with a younger brother. As soon as the baby is handed to Vegeta, he develops an attachment to her. Bulma names the baby Bulla even though Vegeta hoped to give her the Saiyan name Eschalot. However, Vegeta quickly accepts Bulla's name. Goku leaves to recruit members and heads to Krillin's house.

Goku and Gohan arrive at Krillin's house and ask him and No. 18 to join the Tournament of Power. No. 18 convinces Krillin to participate in order to put his newfound martial arts training to use. No. 18 is reluctant to join herself. She quickly suspects Goku and Gohan of hiding something from them, but Goku convinces her that the secret is a 10 million Zeni reward, which convinces her to participate. Gohan decides to test Krillin in a sparring match on the coast. After Gohan overpowers him in hand to hand combat, Krillin swiftly defeats Gohan by blinding him with his new move named Solar Flare x 100 and knocking him into the sea. Goku is excited by Krillin's new power. He challenges him to a sparring match as well. They relocate to a building owned by Mr. Satan, where Krillin's strategies make up for the gap in power, forcing Goku to go Super Saiyan. Goku then transforms into his Super Saiyan Blue form, and he and Krillin have a Kamehameha clash. As Goku increases his power and starts to overpower Krillin, No. 18 intervenes and blocks Goku's Kamehameha, just as Krillin collapses from exhaustion. She justifies herself by noting that the Tournament of Power will be a battle royal and that Goku cannot expect to fight one-on-one all the time. Goku concedes the match and realizes he will have to adjust his tactics in order to win the Tournament of Power. No. 18 reveals that No. 17 is currently working at a wildlife reserve, but she does not know where. Goku decides to ask Dende to find No. 17.

Gohan leaves to recruit Piccolo, while Goku prepares to head to the Lookout. He encounters Majin Buu and Mr. Satan training. Goku discovers that Buu has lost weight and has gotten much slimmer in appearance. The two spar together. Buu defeats Goku by overwhelming him with ki blasts and knocking him out of the fighting stage. Meanwhile, Khai (カイ), the Supreme Kai of Universe 11, gathers all of the Supreme Kais involved in the tournament except for Universe 7's, who is ostracized due to Goku's involvement with the creation of the tournament.

Champa gathers all the Gods of Destruction involved in the tournament except Beerus after finding out about the Supreme Kai's meeting, and they discuss Goku. Toppo recruits his fellow Pride Troopers Kahseral (カーセラル, Kāseraru) and Dyspo (ディスポ, Disupo). Champa recruits Cabba and demands he find more powerful Saiyans.

Goku decides to make Tien the tenth member of the team, and heads off to recruit him and Roshi. At Tien's dojo, a woman named Yurin (ユーリン, Yūrin) with a grudge against Tien arrives and requests to join the dojo. Although Tien denies her because her motivation of beauty was unfit for his dojo, Roshi drags Yurin off to ogle her. Goku arrives and asks Tien to join the Tournament of Power, but, even after Goku bribes him with 10 million Zeni, Tien refuses. Yurin escapes Roshi's advances and uses witchcraft to drive Tien's students on a rampage throughout town. Goku, Tien, Chiaotzu, and Roshi arrive at the village, where Yurin confronts them. Yurin explains that she is a former classmate of Tien's during his time at the Crane School and that she swore revenge on him after he left the school and refused to fight her.

While Chiaotzu temporarily disables Yurin, Goku subdues Roshi with a Kamehameha and cures him of the brainwashing. Tien orders Yurin to apologize to everyone she hurt and offers her a place at his dojo.

Goku's idea is met with much hesitance from his comrades. He explains that he intends to have Fortuneteller Baba resurrect Frieza for 24 hours to fight in the tournament. If Frieza betrays them then either he or Vegeta can defeat him. Goku's friends reluctantly agree, and he sets out to the afterlife. The Universe 7 team are unaware that a spy from Universe 4 is observing them. In Universe 6, Cabba and Caulifla attempt to teach Kale how to turn into a Super Saiyan but to no avail. Kale begins to despair over her own uselessness, and it enrages her enough to trigger her transformation into an extremely powerful Berserker Super Saiyan. Kale immediately goes berserk and attacks Cabba. Caulifla quickly deduces that Kale is jealous of her and Cabba's perceived relationship. She denies having any sort of feelings for Cabba. Kale calms down and collapses in Caulifla's arms. Cabba, who is impressed by Kale's power, decides to add her to Universe 6's team. Back in Universe 7, Goku arrives in the afterlife and receives King Yemma's permission to visit Frieza. He explains about the Tournament of Power and asks Frieza to join them. Frieza agrees to aid him on the condition that he be properly resurrected with Earth's Dragon Balls. When Goku hesitates to agree, Frieza goads him by playing to his desire to see how powerful Frieza can become. Goku accepts his terms. In Universe 4, Ganos (ガノス, Ganosu) reports Universe 7's latest actions to Universe 4's God of Destruction Quitela (キテラ, Kitera) and Supreme Kai Kuru (クル).

He quickly slaughters most of the assassins, which horrifies Goku. The assassins' leader, who has been directly empowered by Sidra, attacks Frieza with Sidra's power, but Frieza manages to overcome and hijack the attack. Frieza spitefully uses the attack on Goku and traps him. Frieza tortures and kills the assassins until they reveal that Roh and Sidra hired them. Frieza contacts Universe 9 and offers his services as a defector. Roh and Sidra begin arguing about whether or not to accept him. Roh fears Frieza's psychopathic and treasonous nature, while Sidra wants his power. Sidra is confident he could kill him if he stepped out of line. Their argument buys time for Beerus and Whis to arrive and rescue Goku. Frieza cuts the connection. He begins making plans to use the Tournament of Power to manipulate the gods to suit his own ends. Goku and Frieza have a brief sparring match, which ends in a draw. Goku, Frieza, Beerus, and Whis return to the Capsule Corporation. The Universe 7 team prepare to travel to the World of Void for the Tournament of Power.

Afterwards, the Great Priest forces them all to clean up their mess and fix the stage. In Universe 7, Gohan and Shin's strategy is to have the team members stick together to conserve energy and use strength of numbers to defeat anyone who attacks them. This suggestion offends Goku and Vegeta's Saiyan pride. Whis transports the team to the World of Void. All of the other universes arrive. Frieza and Frost befriend each other and agree to work together, while Goku singles out Jiren as a potential rival due to his extreme power. As the Great Priest introduces each team, Universe 4 seemingly has only 8 warriors on their team, which confuses most of Universe 7, except for Tien, who tells No. 18 that he can sense a faint presence.

Only Basil, Lavender, and Bergamo remain in the tournament for Team Universe 9. Goku and Vegeta push them to the edge of the stage.

They knock her unconscious and attempt to throw her off the stage, but Caulifla rescues her and defeats Napapa. The two confront Goku, and Caulifla knocks away Universe 2's Jimeze (ジーミズ, Jimizu) and demands to know how to become a Super Saiyan Blue. Goku refuses, and Caulifla transforms into an Ultra Super Saiyan. However, her increased muscle mass cripples her speed and allows Goku to counterattack. With Goku's aid, Caulifla manages to become a Super Saiyan 2, and the two resume their fight. As Kale watches them, she is once again consumed by her feelings of uselessness and transforms into her Berserker Super Saiyan form.

The remaining Pride Troopers regroup and focus their assault on the wounded Caulifla and Kale. Cocotte seals them in a separate dimension to ensure that Goku, No. 17, and No. 18 do not interfere. As the four beat Caulifla, Kale's self-hatred causes her to return to the Berserker Super Saiyan form, but she remains in control of herself this time. Caulifla and Kale use an extremely powerful combination ki blast to defeat Kahseral, Zoiray, and Kettol. Cocotte seals herself in a mini-dimension to avoid the blast, but No. 18 simply throws it off, eliminating Cocotte.

Toppo sends fellow pride trooper Kunshi (クンシー, Kunshī) to back him up. Before Dyspo can land the finishing blow, Hit suddenly turns intangible and sends Dyspo over the edge. However, Kunshi uses ropes made of his energy to pull Dyspo back onto the stage before he is eliminated. The two launch a renewed assault against Hit and drive him into a corner. Before they can finish him off, Goku interferes and rescues Hit. Goku uses his Super Saiyan God form to counter Dyspo's speed, while Hit uses his assassination technique to injure Kunshi. The two switch places. Hit uses a fake Time Skip to throw Dyspo off and wound him, while Goku overwhelms Kunshi with his Super Saiyan Blue form. Hit attempts to eliminate Dyspo, but Kunshi rescues him again. Kunshi charges Hit, who turns intangible and knocks him off the stage. Dyspo retreats and regroups with his allies. Toppo abandons all notions of justice and decides to focus on survival. Hit decides not to battle Goku as thanks for lending a hand. Goku and Hit vow to settle the score if they both make it to the end of the tournament.

August 27, 2017

Master Roshi quietly observes the battles from afar. He is challenged by an attractive warrior from Universe 4, Caway (キャウェイ, Kyauei), who attempts to seduce him. However, Caway's attempts to attack him brings him back to his senses. Roshi destroys her energy weapon, powers up, and drives her to jump off the stage. Roshi is next challenged by Dercori (ダーコリ, Dākori), who is a talisman-wielding warrior from Universe 4. She uses her talismans to confound Roshi with illusions and trap him in a single spot. Roshi uses the Evil Containment Wave to seal her in a small bottle and throw her off the arena. Quitela and Beerus get into an argument about the legality of the move, which is defused when both Zenō-samas rule in Roshi's favor. Ganos, who is enraged at Roshi for eliminating his friends, challenges him and powers up into an avian form. Initially, Roshi is able to use his experience to predict, evade, and counter Ganos' attacks. However, Ganos is able to grow more powerful the longer a fight drags on. He rallies and delivers a fierce series of blows to Roshi. Roshi attempts to hypnotize Ganos into falling asleep, but he attacks himself to wake himself up. Ganos demands that Roshi accept his limits and give up, but Roshi refuses. He unleashes a Max Power Kamehameha that defeats Ganos. However, the effort is too much for Roshi's body to handle, and he collapses. Goku races over to him and successfully defibrillates him with his ki. Goku escorts Roshi to safety.

Goku brings Master Roshi to an isolated part of the stage and leaves him to rest at his request. Gohan and Piccolo are confronted by Universe 6's Dr. Rota (Dr.ロタ, Dokutā Rota), but Rota is shot down by a sniper before he can reveal his ability. Gohan and Piccolo are unable to find the location of the sniper until they find a red orb on the ground. It is revealed that the sniper, Universe 2's Prum (プラン, Puran), can see through these orbs. The lasers ricochet off of the orbs so that his true location is a secret. Piccolo tries to create a smokescreen in order to blur the vision, but Prum can still see them via their heat signatures. Prum shoots Piccolo and destroys both of his arms, which forces him to painfully regenerate them. Gohan and Piccolo realize that the orbs depend on heat signatures and blast the surrounding area to create multiple heat signatures. Prum responds by coming out of his hiding spot and blasting the entire area. Gohan and Piccolo are forced into hiding. Tien analyzes Dr. Rota and deduces that he was hit by a sniper as Goku and Vegeta arrive. Vegeta berates Tien, who warns them about Prum, but Vegeta arrogantly brushes it off until he is almost incapacitated by one of Prum's blasts. As Goku and Tien observe Prum, they deduce that there is another shooter from behind as Prum is merely reflecting the blasts. Vegeta and Goku go after Prum, while Tien goes to save Gohan and Piccolo. Goku and Vegeta try to attack Prum, but their ki blasts are reflected off of his body. Tien navigates through the field of blasts and confronts the true sniper, Prum's teammate Hermila (ハーミラ, Hāmira). Realizing that Prum can deflect ki blasts and not physical attacks, Vegeta and Goku throw giant boulders at him. Tien uses his Multi-form technique in order to buy himself time against Hermila, but three of his clones are shot down. The fourth and final Tien defeats Hermila. Just as Tien is about to eliminate him, Hermila shoots the ground underneath Tien's feet and knocks him off the stage. However, Tien's other three clones come back and drag Hermila down with them. Tien and Hermila are eliminated from the tournament. Although Beerus praises Tien for forcing the battle into a draw, Tien is noticeably upset about being defeated. As Prum is confronted by Vegeta, Dr. Rota comes back and attacks Prum as revenge for shooting him. Shortly after, Vegeta eliminates Prum and Dr. Rota from the tournament.

As Goku battles Ribrianne, the gods of the top four universes speculate on who will win the tournament. Meanwhile, Gohan is confronted by Jimeze. Jimeze makes use of his Instant Transmission technique to confound and damage Gohan. As he prepares to finish him, Frieza intervenes. When Frieza does not immediately attack Jimeze, Universe 7's spectators speculate he may intend to betray and defeat Gohan so he can seize the wish on the Super Dragon Balls for himself. Frieza steps aside and allows Jimeze to continue his fight with Gohan. Jimeze corners Gohan again and attempts to finish him, but Frieza destroys his attack with a ki blast.

Frost appears and declares his intention to defeat Gohan, and Frieza admits that the two intend to work together in order to exact revenge on the Saiyans. Frieza battles Gohan, who counterattacks. Frieza uses his Golden form to knock out Gohan. However, instead of eliminating him, he double-crosses and eliminates Frost.

Ribrianne declares her intention to use the wish to become a love goddess adored by all beings using the Super Dragon Balls. Goku considers using the wish to benefit his family or meet a strong opponent. Ribrianne absorbs the love of her teammates and becomes Super Ribrianne. She attacks Goku with several ki blasts, and he counters by turning Super Saiyan Blue and knocking her away. Ribrianne lands near Jiren, and Goku sees him and prepares to finally battle him. Universe 11's God of Destruction, Belmod, telepathically orders Jiren to defeat Goku. Belmod hopes to demoralize the other universes by defeating the strongest fighter besides Jiren himself. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken x20, but that proves to be no match for Jiren's overwhelming power. Goku begins powering up a Spirit Bomb, and all of his teammates except Vegeta lend him their energy. Despite the time it takes to charge the attack, Jiren agrees to wait for him to complete it. Ribrianne attempts to attack Goku from behind, but she is stopped by Vegeta. Goku completes the Spirit Bomb and throws it, but Jiren deflects it. The two engage in a struggle to take control of the Spirit Bomb. This forces Goku to use Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken x20 to keep up. However, Jiren prevails and begins to overwhelm Goku with his own attack.

Goku rallies himself and pushes the Spirit Bomb back towards Jiren, which locks him in a stalemate. Whis realizes that Jiren is at least as powerful as a God of Destruction. As the two struggle to overpower each other, the Spirit Bomb suddenly condenses into a small black ball, which absorbs Goku and causes him to vanish. The Great Priest rules that since Goku's own attack apparently vaporized him, Jiren will not be disqualified for destroying him. As the Zenō-samas prepare to eliminate Goku, he suddenly reappears and reaches a new level of power. Goku resumes the fight, and he is able to go toe-to-toe with Jiren. Whis theorizes Goku must have absorbed the Spirit Bomb and unlocked an ability called Ultra Instinct (身勝手の極意, Migatte no Goku'i'). Goku uses another powerful attack in an attempt to eliminate Jiren, but he fails and exhausts his newfound power. Jiren knocks him away, and Hit attempts to take advantage of the opportunity and attacks Jiren. Vegeta demands to know what happened to Goku before preparing to fight Ribrianne, while Frieza appears to corner Goku and aim an attack at him.

Instead of killing the defenseless Goku, Frieza shares with him some of his energy and repays his act of mercy during their fight on Planet Namek. Meanwhile, Hit uses his time-skip powers against Jiren, but his attacks fail to connect. Goku spectates the battle, but he is ambushed by Saonel (サオネル, Saoneru) and Pirina (ピリナ, Pirina), Namekians from Universe 6, who are confronted by Gohan and Piccolo. Elsewhere, Vegeta fights Ribrianne, and he is easily overpowering her in his base form until Rozie interferes and retreats with Ribrianne. Ribrianne loses hope due to the gap in power, but Rozie motivates her. Meanwhile, Hit keeps attacking Jiren to no avail, but he is able to react and block most of Jiren's punches. After being knocked back, Hit sneaks up behind Jiren and lands a strong punch on his heart. He knocks Jiren to the edge of the ring after a brief struggle. Hit uses his own time-skip powers continually on Jiren to stop his movement. Realizing that he cannot hold Jiren for long, Hit urges Cabba, Caulifla, and Kale to keep fighting for Universe 6.

As the Tournament of Power reaches its midway point, Jiren begins to meditate. He is certain that there are no other warriors strong enough to fight him. Jiren leaves the fight to Toppo and Dyspo. Viara (ビアラ, Biara) and Katopesla (カトペスラ, Katopesura) of Universe 3 attempt to attack him while meditating, but Jiren's energy alone is enough to push them back.

Caulifla faces off against Monna, but Cabba appears and takes her place. He instructs Caulifla and Kale to retreat for now. Cabba turns Super Saiyan and battles Monna, but he is initially overpowered. Monna almost knocks Cabba off the stage, but Vegeta intervenes and catches him before he can fall. Vegeta and Cabba both promise that, if either of them wins the tournament, the winner will use the Super Dragon Balls to restore the other's erased universe and its inhabitants. Newly inspired, Cabba fights Monna again, but he is losing until he taps into his anger and unlocks Super Saiyan 2. With his new power, Cabba easily defeats and eliminates Monna.

Caulifla demands that Goku fight her and teach her how to unlock Super Saiyan 3 so that she can become strong enough to win the tournament. She begins fighting Goku, who does not initially power up beyond his base form. However, Goku's superior martial arts skills allow him to keep up with her even in her Super Saiyan 2 form. Eventually, she is able to adapt to his moves, which forces Goku to power up to Super Saiyan 2 himself. The two of them fight evenly for some time. Goku later calls in Kale to join the battle. His superior power and skill enables him to fight them both at once, but they are able to match him by working together. They land a massive combined attack on him, but Goku powers up to Super Saiyan 3 and easily deflects their attacks. However, Goku lacks the stamina to maintain that form and reverts to Super Saiyan 2. Kale's desire to become stronger inadvertently causes her to transform into her Berserker Super Saiyan form again.

To counter Goku's increase in power, Kefla powers up to Super Saiyan 2, and the two of them face off. Goku still easily dodges Kefla's attacks, but his own attacks are not enough to take her down. When Goku launches his attacks, it interferes with his concentration and prevents him from using Ultra Instinct to its full potential. Jiren senses the energy from their battle, which prompts him to awaken from his meditation and rejoin Toppo and Dyspo. Vegeta realizes that Ultra Instinct is the level of skill that Whis was training him and Goku to attain. Vegeta decides that he must reach it too. Goku begins running low on stamina. He declares that he will end the fight with his next attack. Kefla panics and unleashes a multitude of deadly energy beams. Her ultimate attack devastates the ring, but Goku easily dodges her blasts while charging a Kamehameha. Goku jumps into the air. Kefla focuses all of her power into a single blast and launches it at him. She takes advantage of his apparent inability to dodge. However, he back flips and uses the charge up energy to slide over her attack and launches his Kamehameha at point-blank range. Goku blasts Kefla out of the ring and eliminates her. Her Potara earrings shatter, and she splits back into Kale and Caulifla. With both of them eliminated, Saonel and Pirina are the only remaining warriors from Team Universe 6.

No. 18 is attacked by the invisible fighter, who is revealed to be one of the missing Universe 4 fighters, Gamisaras (ガミサラス, Gamisarasu). Gohan creates a cloud of dust that coats Gamisaras, which allows Piccolo to see him and then easily eliminates Gamisaras. Undaunted, Quitela orders the remaining Universe 4 fighters to step up their game. Shantza (シャンツァ, Shantsa) generates a dome that envelops the Universe 7 team and manifests illusions of the defeated fighters from the erased universes. However, Piccolo spots Shantza and blasts him off the ring, which eliminates him and destroys the illusions. Universe 4's last fighter, Damon (ダモン, Damon), is also assumed to be invisible since no one can see him. Piccolo is able to sense Damon's attacks, but he proves unable to hit Damon, who knocks him out of the ring and eliminates him. No. 17 discovers the truth and exposes Damon as a tiny bug-like creature rather than an invisible person, which explains why none of the fighters were able to hit him. To solve this problem, Goku repeatedly punches the ring and creates shock waves that launch Damon into the air, which cancels out his agility and allows No. 17 to hit him with energy blasts. No. 17 traps Damon in a miniature force field and kicks him out of the ring to eliminate him. With all of their fighters eliminated, Universe 4 is promptly erased.

280,id2008,"Passage: Hamburgers are Wimpy's all-time favorite food, and he is usually seen carrying or eating one or more at a time – e.g., in Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor he is seen grinding meat or eating burgers almost the entire time – however, he is usually too cheap to pay for them himself. A recurring joke involves Wimpy's attempts to con other patrons of the diner into buying his meal for him. His best-known catchphrase started in 1931 as, ""Cook me up a hamburger. I'll pay you Thursday."" In 1932, this then became the famous, ""I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.""[5] The phrase was also slightly altered in the episode ""Spree Lunch"" to ""I'll have a hamburger, for which I will gladly pay you Tuesday."" This phrase is now commonly used to illustrate financial irresponsibility[6][7][8] and still appears in modern comedies such as The Drew Carey Show and The Office.

585,id3264,"Passage: Relying solely on private donations, Sagrada Familia's construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War, only to resume intermittent progress in the 1950s. Since commencing construction in 1882, advancements in technologies such as computer aided design and computerised numerical control (CNC) have enabled faster progress and construction passed the midpoint in 2010. However, some of the project's greatest challenges remain, including the construction of ten more spires, each symbolising an important Biblical figure in the New Testament.[8] It is anticipated that the building could be completed by 2026—the centenary of Gaudí's death.

The Trashmen had not heard this version but saw a band called The Sorensen Brothers playing it.[2] They decided to play the song that night at their own gig. During this first performance, drummer and vocalist Steve Wahrer stopped playing and ad-libbed the ""Surfin' Bird"" middle section.[2] Despite not knowing ""The Bird's the Word"" was a Rivingtons song, the similarity to ""Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow"" was obvious and The Trashmen added the chorus to the end of their new track.

597,id3312,"Passage: There have been 62 contests, with one winner each year except the tied 1969 contest, which had four. Twenty-seven different countries have won the contest. Switzerland won the first contest in 1956. The country with the highest number of wins is Ireland, with seven. The only person to have won more than once as performer is Ireland's Johnny Logan, who performed ""What's Another Year"" in 1980 and ""Hold Me Now"" in 1987. Logan is also one of only five songwriters to have written more than one winning entry (""Hold Me Now"" 1987 and ""Why Me?"" 1992, performed by Linda Martin).[3] This unique distinction makes Logan the only person to have three Eurovision victories to his/her credit, as either singer, songwriter or both. The other four songwriters with more than one winning entry to their credit are, Willy van Hemert (Netherlands, 1957 and 1959), Yves Dessca (Monaco, 1971 and Luxembourg, 1972), Rolf Løvland (Norway, 1985 and 1995) and Brendan Graham (Ireland, 1994 and 1996).

824,id4188,"Passage: The Roman Empire (Latin: Imperium Rōmānum; Classical Latin: [ɪmˈpɛ.ri.ũː roːˈmaː.nũː] Koine and Medieval Greek: Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων, tr. Basileia tōn Rhōmaiōn) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world c. 100 BC –  c. AD 400, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around AD 500,[5][6] and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time).[n 7][7] The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus, effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.

In June 1994 in GNU's bulletin, Linux was referred to as a ""free UNIX clone"", and the Debian project began calling its product Debian GNU/Linux. In May 1996, Richard Stallman published the editor Emacs 19.31, in which the type of system was renamed from Linux to Lignux. This spelling was intended to refer specifically to the combination of GNU and Linux, but this was soon abandoned in favor of ""GNU/Linux"".[citation needed]

It was named Nuevo México after the Aztec Valley of Mexico by Spanish settlers, 223 years before the establishment of the present-day country of Mexico. The present-day state of New Mexico was not named after, nor is it a part of, Mexico.[7][8] Its geographic characteristics made settlement and effective political control difficult which prompted Mexico's invasion and control of the area from 1824 to 1846. New Mexico's Spanish origins made cultural integration with Mexico unsuitable, which sparked the Revolt of 1837 and a growing economic association with the expanding United States. The 1848 Mexican–American War indirectly capitalized on this tension and created the U.S. New Mexico Territory. It was admitted to the Union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912.

It was constructed initially with two boiling water reactor (BWR) units by Bechtel and GE under the 1963 123 Agreement between India, the United States, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Units 1 and 2 were brought online for commercial operation on 28 October 1969 with an initial power of 210 MW of electricity, later on this was reduced to 160 MW due to technical difficulties.[1] These were the first of their kind in Asia. More recently, an additional two pressurised heavy water reactor (PHWR) units of 540 MW each were constructed by L&T and Gammon India, seven months ahead of schedule and well within the original cost estimates. Unit 3 was brought online for commercial operation on 18 August 2006, and unit 4 on 12 September 2005.[1]

Many of these, though by no means all, contain human remains, but it is debatable whether use as burial sites was their primary function. The megalithic structures of Malta are believed to be the oldest in Europe, in particular Skorba Temples. Though generally known as dolmens, the correct term accepted by archaeologists is portal tomb. However many local names exist, such as anta in Galicia and Portugal, stazzone in Sardinia, hunebed in the Netherlands, Hünengrab in Germany, dysse in Denmark, and cromlech in Wales.

859,id455,"Passage: Treaty power is a co-ordinated effort between the Executive branch and the Senate. The President may form and negotiate, but the treaty must be advised and consented to by a two-thirds vote in the Senate. Only after the Senate approves the treaty can the President ratify it. Once it is ratified, it becomes binding on all the states under the Supremacy Clause. While the House of Representatives does not vote on it at all, the requirement for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification makes it considerably more difficult to rally enough political support for international treaties. Also, if implementation of the treaty requires the expenditure of funds, the House of Representatives may be able to block or at least impede such implementation by refusing to vote for the appropriation of the necessary funds.

Parsons and Frank L. Stulen. The first commercial, digital and programmable robot was built by George Devol in 1954 and was named the Unimate.

170,id1594,"Passage: The caps at both poles consist primarily of water ice. Frozen carbon dioxide accumulates as a comparatively thin layer about one metre thick on the north cap in the northern winter only, while the south cap has a permanent dry ice cover about 8 m thick.[4] The northern polar cap has a diameter of about 1000 km during the northern Mars summer,[5] and contains about 1.6 million cubic km of ice, which if spread evenly on the cap would be 2 km thick.[6] (This compares to a volume of 2.85 million cubic km (km3) for the Greenland ice sheet.) The southern polar cap has a diameter of 350 km and a thickness of 3 km.[7] The total volume of ice in the south polar cap plus the adjacent layered deposits has also been estimated at 1.6 million cubic km.[8] Both polar caps show spiral troughs, which recent analysis of SHARAD ice penetrating radar has shown are a result of roughly perpendicular katabatic winds that spiral due to the Coriolis Effect.[9][10]

226,id1836,"Passage: Flair triumphantly returned to WCW as a hero in February 1993, as a result of a ""no-compete"" clause he was unable to wrestle, so he hosted a short-lived talk show in WCW called A Flair for the Gold. Arn Anderson usually appeared at the bar on the show's set, and Flair's maid Fifi cleaned or bore gifts. Once he returned to action, Flair briefly held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship for a tenth time after defeating Barry Windham at Beach Blast before WCW finally left the NWA in September 1993. At Fall Brawl, Flair lost the title, now rebranded the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship, to ""Ravishing Rick"" Rude. At Starrcade in 1993, Flair defeated Vader to win the WCW World Heavyweight title for the second time. In the spring of 1994, Flair began a tweener turn and started another feud with longtime rival Ricky Steamboat and challenged Steamboat to a match at Spring Stampede which ended in a no contest from a double pin, causing the title to be held up. Flair then defeated Steamboat in a rematch to reclaim the held-up title on an episode of WCW Saturday Night. The WWE does not count this victory as a new title win. Flair then challenged Col. Robert Parker to wrestle one of his men at Slamboree, which turned out to be Barry Windham, whom Flair defeated, afterwards he quietly turned heel and took Sherri Martel as his manager. He would also wrestle Lord Steven Regal in a five-match series under Marquess of Queensberry Rules, which aired on WCW Worldwide between April 30 and May 28, in which Flair won the series, with 2 wins, 1 loss, and 2 draws.

The battle has been passed down in Islamic history as a decisive victory attributable to divine intervention, or by secular sources to the strategic genius of Muhammad. It is one of the few battles specifically mentioned in the Quran. All knowledge of the battle at Badr comes from traditional Islamic accounts, both hadiths and biographies of Muhammad, recorded in written form some time after the battle. There is little evidence outside of these of the battle. There are no descriptions of the battle prior to the 9th Century.[2]

156,id155,"Passage: A muscle relaxant is a drug that affects skeletal muscle function and decreases the muscle tone. It may be used to alleviate symptoms such as muscle spasms, pain, and hyperreflexia. The term ""muscle relaxant"" is used to refer to two major therapeutic groups: neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics. Neuromuscular blockers act by interfering with transmission at the neuromuscular end plate and have no central nervous system (CNS) activity. They are often used during surgical procedures and in intensive care and emergency medicine to cause temporary paralysis. Spasmolytics, also known as ""centrally acting"" muscle relaxants, are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions. While both neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics are often grouped together as muscle relaxants,[1][2] the term is commonly used to refer to spasmolytics only.[3][4]

The Nexus 5 uses a 4.95-inch (marketed as 5-inch) 445 PPI 1080p IPS display, and includes an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera with optical image stabilization (OIS), and a 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera. The Nexus 5 supports LTE networks where available, unlike the Nexus 4 which unofficially supported LTE on AWS Band 4 only with a hidden software option, but was not formally approved or marketed for any LTE use.[20][21] There are two variants of the Nexus 5, with varying support for cellular frequency bands; one is specific to North America (LG-D820), and the other is designed for the rest of the world (LG-D821).[20]

To escape the decline their world is facing, people turn to the OASIS,[a] a virtual reality simulator accessible by players using visors and haptic technology such as gloves. It functions both as an MMORPG and as a virtual society, with its currency being the most stable in the real world. It was created by James Halliday who, when he died, had announced in his will to the public that he had left an Easter egg inside OASIS, and the first person to find it would inherit his entire fortune and the corporation. The story follows the adventures of Wade Watts, starting about five years after the announcement, when he discovers one of the three keys pointing to the treasure.

233,id1862,"Passage: Johannes Gutenberg, a goldsmith by profession, developed, circa 1439, a printing system by adapting existing technologies to printing purposes, as well as making inventions of his own. Printing in East Asia had been prevalent since the Tang dynasty,[3][4] and in Europe, woodblock printing based on existing screw presses was common by the 14th century. Gutenberg's most important innovation was the development of hand-molded metal printing matrices, thus producing a movable type based printing press system. His newly devised hand mould made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities. Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe. In Europe, the two inventions, the hand mould and the printing press, together drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents, particularly in short print runs.

Rooney raised the orphan Sullivan and loves him more than his own biological son, Connor. Rooney sends Connor and Sullivan to meet with disgruntled associate Finn McGovern, but Connor shoots McGovern, resulting in Sullivan gunning down McGovern's men. Sullivan's twelve-year-old son Michael, Jr. had hidden in his father's car and witnesses the event. Despite Sullivan swearing his son to secrecy and Rooney pressuring Connor to apologize for the reckless action, Connor murders Sullivan's wife Annie and younger son Peter.

474,id2846,"Passage: In photosynthesis, the light-dependent reactions take place on the thylakoid membranes. The inside of the thylakoid membrane is called the lumen, and outside the thylakoid membrane is the stroma, where the light-independent reactions take place. The thylakoid membrane contains some integral membrane protein complexes that catalyze the light reactions. There are four major protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane: Photosystem II (PSII), Cytochrome b6f complex, Photosystem I (PSI), and ATP synthase. These four complexes work together to ultimately create the products ATP and NADPH.

Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British, American public opinion reflected that of the president: the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans, German Americans and Scandinavian Americans,[1] as well as among church leaders and among women in general. On the other hand, even before World War I had broken out, American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe.[2] Over time, especially after reports of atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915, the American citizens increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor in Europe.

502,id2952,"Passage: Green tree frogs are very docile and unafraid of humans.[10] They are nocturnal[6] and come out in early evenings to call (in spring and summer) and hunt for food. During the day, they find cool, dark, and moist areas, such as tree holes or rock crevices, in which to sleep. They are not a rainforest species, but make use of the rain that falls almost daily and collects on leaves and in crevices, to keep themselves moist. Their skin exudes a waxy coating that helps prevent evaporation.

The purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the Earth allowing communication between widely separated points.[2] Communications satellites use a wide range of radio and microwave frequencies. To avoid signal interference, international organizations have regulations for which frequency ranges or ""bands"" certain organizations are allowed to use.

764,id3958,"Passage: The manga begins in 2001, when the Diamond Is Unbreakable character Koichi Hirose goes to Naples at the request of Jotaro Kujo to find someone known as Haruno Shiobana and get a skin sample of theirs. Shiobana turns out to be a middle school student named Giorno Giovanna—which sounds similar to ""Haruno Shiobana""—who is the son of Dio Brando. Giorno attempts to steal Koichi's luggage, but is stopped by Koichi's Stand, Echoes Act Three. Giorno recognized his power as being a Stand power similar to his Gold Experience, a Stand that can give life to inanimate objects. The story then follows Giorno as he tries to become a boss of the mafia in order to make Naples a better place and help its people, specifically where availability of drugs to young people are concerned. After an altercation with gang member Leaky Eye Luka, he attempts to join Passione, an organized crime group that employs many Stand users (essentially, his vision for Passione is akin to Robin Hood's band, in contrast to the sheer powerlust of its current leader). He is approached by a member of Passione, Bruno Bucciarati, who suspects him of killing Luka. During the fight readers are introduced to Buciarati's Stand, Sticky Fingers, that can place and open a zipper on any surface. Bucciarati challenges Giorno to complete the rite to join Passione, and therefore visit the Capo, Polpo, in prison.

312,id2148,"Passage: After Scheidemann′s resignation, a new coalition government was formed under Gustav Bauer. President Friedrich Ebert knew that Germany was in an impossible situation. Although he shared his countrymen's disgust with the treaty, he was sober enough to consider the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject it. He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty, the Allies would invade Germany from the west—and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion. With this in mind, he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event the Allies resumed the war. If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out, Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty. Hindenburg—after prodding from his chief of staff, Wilhelm Groener—concluded the army could not resume the war even on a limited scale. However, rather than inform Ebert himself, he had Groener inform the government that the army would be in an untenable position in the event of renewed hostilities. Upon receiving this, the new government recommended signing the treaty. The National Assembly voted in favour of signing the treaty by 237 to 138, with five abstentions (there were 421 delegates in total). This result was wired to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline. Foreign minister Hermann Müller and colonial minister Johannes Bell travelled to Versailles to sign the treaty on behalf of Germany. The treaty was signed on 28 June 1919 and ratified by the National Assembly on 9 July by a vote of 209 to 116.[107]

647,id3504,"Passage: Ashes are ceremonially placed on the heads of Christians on Ash Wednesday, either by being sprinkled over their heads or, in English-speaking countries, more often by being marked on their foreheads as a visible cross. The words (based on Genesis 3:19) used traditionally to accompany this gesture are, ""Memento, homo, quia pulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris."" (""Remember, man, that thou art dust, and to dust thou shalt return."") This custom is credited to Pope Gregory I the Great (c. 540–604).[26] In the 1969 revision of the Roman Rite, an alternative formula (based on Mark 1:15) was introduced and given first place ""Repent, and believe in the Gospel"" and the older formula was translated as ""Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return."" The old formula, based on the words spoken to Adam and Eve after their sin,[27] reminds worshippers of their sinfulness and mortality and thus, implicitly, of their need to repent in time.[28] The newer formula makes explicit what was only implicit in the old.

Bush (a former Governor of Texas) often had the ice cream shipped to Camp David during his administration.[18] In 2006 and 2012, astronauts aboard the International Space Station were also treated to Blue Bell ice cream ""to help out (the crew's) happiness quotient.""[19]

232,id1856,"Passage: The term ""cradle of civilization"" refers to locations where, according to current archeological data, civilization is understood to have emerged. Current thinking is that there was no single ""cradle"", but several civilizations that developed independently, with the Fertile Crescent (Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt) understood to be the earliest.[1] Other civilizations arose in Asia among cultures situated along large river valleys, such as Indo-Gangetic Plain in the Indian subcontinent[2][3] and the Yellow River in China.[4] The extent to which there was significant influence between the early civilizations of the Near East and those of East Asia is disputed. Scholars accept that the civilizations of Mesoamerica, mainly in modern Mexico, and Norte Chico in present-day Peru emerged independently from those in Eurasia.[5]

The music was composed by lead vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump, with all lyrics penned by bassist Pete Wentz, continuing the band's songwriting approach they took for some songs on their prior 2003 effort Take This to Your Grave. Neal Avron handled production duties. Commenting on the record's lyrical themes, Wentz said the lyrics were about ""the anxiety and depression that goes along with looking at your own life.""[5] In support of their release the group headlined tours worldwide and played at various music festivals. For their Black Clouds and Underdogs tour the album was re-released as From Under the Cork Tree (Limited ""Black Clouds and Underdogs"" Edition), featuring new songs and remixes.

It threatened but did not reach the aristocratic district of Westminster, Charles II's Palace of Whitehall, and most of the suburban slums.[2] It consumed 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, St Paul's Cathedral, and most of the buildings of the City authorities. It is estimated to have destroyed the homes of 70,000 of the City's 80,000 inhabitants.[3]

This was celebrated in ancient Rome with gift-giving during the Saturnalia holiday, which took place that month.[1] As Christianity became increasingly widespread in the Roman lands, the custom of gift-giving continued.[2] Around the year 336 AD the date of December 25 appears to have become established as the day of Jesus's birth, and the tradition of gift-giving was reinterpreted and tied to the story of three Magi giving gifts to baby Jesus; together with another story, that of Santa Claus based on the historical figure of Saint Nicholas, a fourth-century Greek bishop and gift-giver, it slowly became a part of Christmas celebrations.[1][2]",0.17204301075268819,283,The tradition of gift giving came from pagan winter solstice celebrations and the Roman Saturnalia festival.,0.09090909090909091,163,Pagan custom,0.0,149,Ancient Rome,0.4,149, Pagan,0.0,148, pagan custom,0.0,149," ancient Rome with gift-giving during the Saturnalia holiday, which took place that month.",0.7000000000000001,160, pagan custom,0.0,149,"The tradition of gift-giving came from the pagan custom of the winter solstice, which was celebrated in ancient Rome during the Saturnalia holiday.

595,id3304,"Passage: ""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?"", also sung as ""Buddy, Can You Spare a Dime?"", is one of the best-known American songs of the Great Depression. Written in 1930 by lyricist E. Y. ""Yip"" Harburg and composer Jay Gorney, ""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?"" was part of the 1932 musical revue Americana;[1] the melody is based on a Russian-Jewish lullaby Gorney's mother had sung to him as a child.[2][3] It was considered by Republicans to be anti-capitalist propaganda, and almost dropped from the show; attempts were made to ban it from the radio.[4] The song became best known, however, through recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee. They were released right before Franklin Delano Roosevelt's election to the presidency. The Brunswick Crosby recording made on October 25, 1932 with Lennie Hayton and his Orchestra[5] became the best-selling record of its period, and came to be viewed as an anthem to the shattered dreams of the era.[6]

43,id1130,"Passage: In modern mapping, a topographic map is a type of map characterized by large-scale detail and quantitative representation of relief, usually using contour lines, but historically using a variety of methods. Traditional definitions require a topographic map to show both natural and man-made features.

It was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947, and it became the official flag of the Dominion of India on 15 August 1947. The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Republic of India. In India, the term ""tricolour"" (Hindi: तिरंगा, translit. Tiraṅgā) almost always refers to the Indian national flag.

West gets food poisoning from a kebab stand and then Michelle has to step in for him. It seemed that he would not dance in the semifinals however just before they went onto the stage he rushed and claimed that he was well enough to dance. Therefore Michelle had to make a choice wherever to dance herself or let West dance. West then went on with the team and Michelle and Amanda watched on from the wings with Kate.

649,id3510,"Passage: Many Brazilians decorate their homes with a Christmas Tree, there is no rule, the parents can decorate it by themselves as a surprise to the kids, or they can do it together. In addition to the Christmas tree, many families set up a Nativity scene as the main decoration. Nativity scenes are very popular in Brazil, and can be seen everywhere including churches and popular places around the town. Like many other countries, Christmas dinner in Brazil is normally served late in the evening on Christmas Eve around 10 or 11 p.m. The meal often includes farofa stuffing, assortments of fruit, fried cod, and roast turkey with a dessert called ""rabanada"".

It was written by Hugo Peretti, Luigi Creatore, and George David Weiss.[2] The melody is based on ""Plaisir d'amour"",[4] a popular romance by Jean-Paul-Égide Martini (1784). The song was featured in Presley's 1961 film, Blue Hawaii. During the following four decades, it was recorded by numerous other artists, including Tom Smothers, Swedish pop group A-Teens, and the British reggae group UB40, whose 1993 version topped the U.S. and UK charts.

257,id1944,"Passage: A spiral galaxy like the Milky Way contains stars, stellar remnants, and a diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) of gas and dust. The interstellar medium consists of 10−4 to 106 particles per cm3 and is typically composed of roughly 70% hydrogen by mass, with most of the remaining gas consisting of helium. This medium has been chemically enriched by trace amounts of heavier elements that were ejected from stars as they passed beyond the end of their main sequence lifetime. Higher density regions of the interstellar medium form clouds, or diffuse nebulae,[2] where star formation takes place.[3] In contrast to spirals, an elliptical galaxy loses the cold component of its interstellar medium within roughly a billion years, which hinders the galaxy from forming diffuse nebulae except through mergers with other galaxies.[4]

Hanna's best friend, Mona Vanderwaal, informs the girls that she has also received texts from A, drawing the five closer together in trying to figure out who their tormentor is. Mona subtly encourages Spencer's fears that her sister, Melissa, might be A as well as Alison's killer. During Hanna's recovery masquerade celebration, she suddenly regains her memory, revealing that Mona is A. However, she, Emily, and Aria can't do much about it, because Spencer and Mona are on their way to the police station. After Spencer is warned about Mona by text, she tries to escape Mona's car, but Mona catches on rather quickly and diverts to a path in a more remote area of Rosewood. She tells Spencer everything, from seeing Ali launch a firework into Toby Cavanaugh's garage and blind her friend Jenna, to finding Ali's diary of secrets among a pile of old DiLaurentis junk the St. Germains left at the curb, discovering the girls' secrets that only Ali knew. Her motivation was to get revenge for her friend's blindness, even though Jenna and Ali had planned together to launch the firework. Mona didn't know this and got a scar on her stomach from the ordeal. Mona also drops the bombshell that Ian Thomas killed Ali, due to Ali's last diary entry about giving him an ultimatum to break up with Melissa. She then offers Spencer to become A with her and tell Hanna that she must not be remembering correctly, but she refuses. The two fight at Floating Man's Quarry and Spencer accidentally pushes Mona, who falls and has her neck caught between rocks.

545,id3120,"Passage: In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Voldemort's manifestation is as a face on the back of Quirrell's head, an effect achieved by computer generated imagery. Ian Hart, the actor who played Quirrell in the same film, provided the voice and the facial source for this character. Voldemort also appears in a scene in the Forbidden Forest where he is seen drinking the blood of a unicorn. As Voldemort's face was altered enough by CG work, and Hart's voice was affected enough, there was no confusion by Hart's playing of the two roles. In that film, he was also shown in a flashback sequence when he arrived at the home of James and Lily Potter to kill them. In this scene Voldemort is played by Richard Bremmer,[34] though his face is never seen. His next appearance would be in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as the 16-year-old Tom Marvolo Riddle (portrayed by Christian Coulson).

612,id3368,"Passage: Given the problems of the proton–electron model,[38][39] it was quickly accepted that the atomic nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons, although the precise nature of the neutron was initially unclear. Within months after the discovery of the neutron, Werner Heisenberg[59][60][61][15] and Dmitri Ivanenko[62] had proposed proton–neutron models for the nucleus.[63] Heisenberg's landmark papers approached the description of protons and neutrons in the nucleus through quantum mechanics. While Heisenberg's theory for protons and neutrons in the nucleus was a ""major step toward understanding the nucleus as a quantum mechanical system,""[64] he still assumed the presence of nuclear electrons. In particular, Heisenberg assumed the neutron was a proton–electron composite, for which there is no quantum mechanical explanation. Heisenberg had no explanation for how lightweight electrons could be bound within the nucleus. Heisenberg introduced the first theory of nuclear exchange forces that bind the nucleons. He considered protons and neutrons to be different quantum states of the same particle, i.e., nucleons distinguished by the value of their nuclear isospin quantum numbers.

189,id1678,"Passage: The National Football League Draft, also called the Player Selection Meeting, is an annual event in which it serves as the league's most common source of player recruitment. The basic design of the draft is that each team is given a position in the drafting order in reverse order relative to its record in the previous year, which means that the last place team is positioned first. From this position, the team can either select a player or trade their position to another team for other draft positions, a player or players, or any combination thereof. The round is complete when each team has either selected a player or traded its draft position. Certain aspects of the draft, including team positioning and the number of rounds in the draft, have seen revisions since its first creation in 1936, but the fundamental methodology has remained the same. Currently the draft consists of seven rounds. The original rationale in creating the draft was to increase the competitive parity between the teams as the worst team would, ideally, have chosen the best player available.

758,id3940,"Passage: Running parallel to the shoreline about 5 miles (8.0 km) from Utah Beach, the marshes of the Merderet and Douve formed a natural defensive line protecting the western end of the Allied landing zone and at the same time limiting the Allies' potential to break out of the beachhead. Thus control of the bridges at Manoir de la Fière and Chef-du-Pont was seen as vital. The Merderet was assigned to the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division as Mission Boston, scheduled for 5 hours before the amphibious landings on D-Day. Cloud cover and German fire caused the landings to be dispersed; the paratroopers took the strategic town of Sainte-Mère-Église but failed in their original mission to clear the west bank of the Merderet on D-Day and blow the bridge over the Douze at Pont l'Abbé (now Étienville). The extent of their control of the bridges over the Merderet is disputed, but it was sufficient to hold off German counterattacks. These included an attack over the causeway at La Fiere by the 1057th Grenadier Regiment and light tanks of the 100th Panzer Replacement Battalion. This appears to have been the inspiration for the climactic battle in the film Saving Private Ryan, which is set around a bridge over the Merderet in the fictional town of Ramelle.

252,id193,"Passage: 
The right-most label conveys the top-level domain; for example, the domain name www.example.com belongs to the top-level domain com.
The hierarchy of domains descends from the right to the left label in the name; each label to the left specifies a subdivision, or subdomain of the domain to the right. For example: the label example specifies a node example.com as a subdomain of the com domain, and www is a label to create www.example.com, a subdomain of example.com. Each label may contain from 1 to 63 octets. The empty label is reserved for the root node and when fully qualified is expressed as the empty label terminated by a dot. The full domain name may not exceed a total length of 253 ASCII characters in its textual representation.[5] Thus, when using a single character per label, the limit is 127 levels: 127 characters plus 126 dots have a total length of 253. In practice, some domain registries may have shorter limits.
A hostname is a domain name that has at least one associated IP address. For example, the domain names www.example.com and example.com are also hostnames, whereas the com domain is not. However, other top-level domains, particularly country code top-level domains, may indeed have an IP address, and if so, they are also hostnames.
Hostnames impose restrictions on the characters allowed in the corresponding domain name. A valid hostname is also a valid domain name, but a valid domain name may not necessarily be valid as a hostname.

785,id4036,"Passage: In a chemical reaction, chemical equilibrium is the state in which both reactants and products are present in concentrations which have no further tendency to change with time, so that there is no observable change in the properties of the system.[1] Usually, this state results when the forward reaction proceeds at the same rate as the reverse reaction. The reaction rates of the forward and backward reactions are generally not zero, but equal. Thus, there are no net changes in the concentrations of the reactant(s) and product(s).

Billy Crystal as Michael ""Mike"" Wazowski, a short, round green monster with a single big eyeball and skinny limbs. Mike is Sulley's station runner and coach on the scare floor, and the two are close friends and roommates. Mike is charming and generally the more organized of the two, but is prone to neurotics and his ego sometimes leads him astray. He is dating Celia Mae, who calls him ""Googly-Bear"".
Mary Gibbs as Mary ""Boo"", a three-year-old[3][4][5] human girl who is unafraid of any monster except Randall, the scarer assigned to her door. She believes Sulley is a large cat and refers to him as ""Kitty"". The book based on the film gives Boo's ""real"" name as Mary Gibbs, the name of her voice actress. In the film, one of Boo's drawings is covered with the name ""Mary"".
Steve Buscemi as Randall Boggs, a purple eight-legged lizard monster with a chameleon-like ability to change skin color and blend in completely with his surroundings. He is a snide and preening character who makes himself a rival to Sulley and Mike in scream collection.
James Coburn as Henry J. Waternoose III, an arthropodic monster with a crab-like lower body. Waternoose is the CEO of Monsters, Inc., a job passed down through his family for three generations. He acts as a mentor to Sulley, holding great faith in him as a scarer.
Jennifer Tilly as Celia Mae, a gorgon-like monster with one eye and tentacle-like legs. Celia is the receptionist for Monsters, Inc. and Mike's girlfriend.
Bob Peterson as Roz, a slug-like monster with a raspy voice reminiscent of Selma Diamond's who administrates for Scarefloor F where Sulley, Mike, and Randall work. At the end of the movie, it is revealed that Roz is ""agent number 1"" of the CDA, and has worked undercover at Monsters, Inc. for two and a half years.
John Ratzenberger as Yeti[6] aka. The Abominable Snowman,[7] a furry white monster who was banished to the Himalayas. He was inspired by the Abominable Snowman from the 1964 Rankin/Bass animated special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.[8]
Frank Oz as Jeff Fungus, Randall's red-skinned, three-eyed assistant. He is generally incompetent and is often bullied by Randall.
Dan Gerson as Smitty and Needleman, two goofy adolescent monsters with cracking voices who work as janitors and operate the Door Shredder when required. The pair of them idolize Sulley and are generally seen as a nuisance by Mike.
Steve Susskind as Jerry Slugworth, a red seven-fingered monster who manages Scare Floor F and is a good friend of Waternoose.
Bonnie Hunt as Ms. Flint, a female monster who trains new monsters to scare children.
Jeff Pidgeon as Thaddeus ""Phlegm"" Bile, a trainee scarer for Monsters, Inc.
Samuel Lord Black as George Sanderson, a chubby, oranged-furred monster with a sole horn on top of his head. A running gag throughout the film involves George repeatedly making contact with human artifacts (such as socks and the like which cling to his fur via static), prompting his scare coach to trigger ""23–19"" incidents with the CDA resulting in him mobbed, shaved bald, and sterilized. He is good friends with Pete ""Claws"" Ward.

551,id3144,"Passage: Mexico is one of the world's most seismically active regions, sitting atop several intersecting tectonic plates. The border between the Cocos Plate and North American Plate, along the Pacific Coast of Mexico, creates a subduction zone that generates large seismic events.[2] Activity along the edges of the Rivera and Caribbean plates also generate seismic events. All together, these seismic forces cause an average of 40 earthquakes a day in Mexico.[11]

Portrayed by actress Jayma Mays, Emma has appeared in Glee from its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Emma was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. She is a guidance counselor at the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio where the series is set. Emma suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder and has romantic feelings for glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), but becomes engaged to football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) as Will is married. Ken ultimately breaks up with her on their wedding day because of her feelings for Will, and when Will leaves his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), he and Emma share a kiss. Their relationship is short-lived, and in the second season, Emma and her dentist boyfriend Carl Howell (John Stamos) marry in Las Vegas. The wedding is later annulled as it was unconsummated. At the beginning of the third season, she and Will are living together; they become engaged shortly after New Years, and consummate their relationship near the end of the school year. Emma leaves Will at the altar midway through the fourth season, but the two later reconcile and marry in the season finale. She becomes pregnant during the middle of the fifth season.

It is connected to part of the Atlantic Ocean through the Florida Straits between the U.S. and Cuba, and with the Caribbean (with which it forms the American Mediterranean Sea) via the Yucatán Channel between Mexico and Cuba. With the narrow connection to the Atlantic, the Gulf experiences very small tidal ranges. The size of the Gulf basin is approximately 1.6 million km2 (615,000 sq mi).

In July 1941, the Baltic territory was incorporated into the Reichskommissariat Ostland of the Third Reich. As a result of the Baltic Offensive of 1944, the Soviet Union recaptured most of the Baltic states and trapped the remaining German forces in the Courland pocket until their formal surrender in May 1945.[5] The Soviet ""annexation occupation"" (Annexionsbesetzung or occupation sui generis)[6] of the Baltic states lasted until August 1991, when the Baltic states regained independence.

People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about why things are the way they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways. The most conclusive testing of hypotheses comes from reasoning based on carefully controlled experimental data.

942,id781,"Passage: Plasmodesmata (singular: plasmodesma) are microscopic channels which traverse the cell walls of plant cells[2] and some algal cells, enabling transport and communication between them. Plasmodesmata evolved independently in several lineages,[3] and species that have these structures include members of the Charophyceae, Charales, Coleochaetales and Phaeophyceae (which are all algae), as well as all embryophytes, better known as land plants.[4] Unlike animal cells, almost every plant cell is surrounded by a polysaccharide cell wall. Neighbouring plant cells are therefore separated by a pair of cell walls and the intervening middle lamella, forming an extracellular domain known as the apoplast. Although cell walls are permeable to small soluble proteins and other solutes, plasmodesmata enable direct, regulated, symplastic transport of substances between cells. There are two forms of plasmodesmata: primary plasmodesmata, which are formed during cell division, and secondary plasmodesmata, which can form between mature cells.[5]

555,id3156,"Passage: In rugby union a scrum is a means of restarting play after a minor infringement. It involves up to eight players from each team, known as the pack or forward pack, binding together in three rows and interlocking with the free opposing teams forwards. At this point the ball is fed into the gap between the two forward packs and they both compete for the ball to win possession. Teams can be penalised for intentionally causing the scrum to collapse, and for not putting the ball into the scrum correctly. A scrum is most commonly awarded when the ball is knocked forward, or passed forward, or when a ball becomes trapped in a ruck or maul.

57,id1166,"Passage: The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is one of the two components of the nervous system, the other part is the central nervous system (CNS). The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord.[1] The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body.[2] Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull, or by the blood–brain barrier, which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. In the somatic nervous system, the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve (cranial nerve II), along with the retina. The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon.[3] Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS. However, the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS.[4] The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands. The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states: sympathetic and parasympathetic.

331,id2234,"Passage: The Boston Massacre, known as the Incident on King Street by the British,[2] was an incident on March 5, 1770, in which British Army soldiers shot and killed people while under attack by a mob. The incident was heavily publicized by leading Patriots, such as Paul Revere and Samuel Adams, to encourage rebellion against the British authorities.[3][4][5] British troops had been stationed in Boston, capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, since 1768 in order to protect and support crown-appointed colonial officials attempting to enforce unpopular Parliamentary legislation. Amid ongoing tense relations between the population and the soldiers, a mob formed around a British sentry, who was subjected to verbal abuse and harassment. He was eventually supported by eight additional soldiers, who were subjected to verbal threats and repeatedly hit by clubs, stones and snowballs. They fired into the crowd, without orders, instantly killing three people and wounding others. Two more people died later of wounds sustained in the incident.

945,id79,"Passage: Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats.[74] Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons.[73] Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%.[75] The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI,[76] and NIRS.[77] The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar),[73] but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic[78] and heptanoic[79] acids), lactate,[80] acetate,[81] and possibly amino acids.[82]

948,id805,"Passage: Gestalt psychology or gestaltism (German: Gestalt [ɡəˈʃtalt] ""shape, form"") is a philosophy of mind of the Berlin School of experimental psychology. Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world. The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self-organizing tendencies. The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking.[1][2] The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception.[2] In the introduction to a 2016 special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception, the authors concluded that ""even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists, there is little theoretical coherence. What happened to the Gestalt school that always aspired to provide a unified vision of psychology? Perhaps there is, in fact, little that holds the classic phenomena of Gestalt psychology together.""[3]

267,id1972,"Passage: While Karnataka became independent with the rest of the country on 15 August 1947, this did not occur in some parts of the state that were under the rule of the Nizam of Hyderabad. Hyderabad consisted of large portions of what were later to be the north eastern districts of Bidar, Gulbarga and Raichur of Karnataka state. The Lingayat minority in these regions also largely believed that they had been neglected and resented the oppression of the Nizam and the Razakars. The Nizam refused to accede to India until his rule was overthrown by force. Following the 'police action' against the Nizam, Hyderabad province and its citizens became independent on 17 September 1948. This day is celebrated by the Karnataka government as the Hyderabad-Karnataka liberation day.[2]

136,id1458,"Passage: James Long believed that the British mercantile community and even the Government unjustly and oppressively treated the Indigo cultivators. His view concurred with Dinabandhu Mitra who expressed his sentiments in a play entitled Nil Darpan (the original Bengali play was written by him) and published anonymously from Dhaka in 1860. Mitra sent Long a copy of the play as early as 1861. Long brought it to the notice of W. S Seton-Karr, Secretary to the Governor of Bengal and ex-President of the Indigo Commission. Seton-Karr, sensing its importance, mentioned Nil Durpan in conversation with the Lieutenant Governor, Grant.Grant expressed a wish to see a translation of it and print a few copies to be circulated privately amongst friends. After the discussion, Seton-Karr asked Long to arrange for a translation of the play in English. Michael Madhusudan Dutta translated it under the supervision of Long. Long as the editor cut out some coarse passages and wrote a short prefatory note for the play. When the translation was complete, Seton-Karr ordered printing of five hundred copies in lieu of Grant's wish of a few copies. Then Long sent the translated manuscripts to Clement Henry Manuel, the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press to print five hundred copies and the cost came to around Rs.300. It was published in April or May 1861. Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor, Long began sending out the copies in official Government envelopes that had the heading: ""on her Majesty's Service"".[5] The translation revealed the nature of the oppression against the indigo planters. It naturally offended the establishment of the play so much that a razing propaganda was started by the Anglo-Indian Press against the publisher and the translator. One of the leading newspapers named The Englishmen and some indigo planters instituted a libel suit against Long and the printer- C. H. Manuel. The words mentioned in Long's Introduction to the play stated that what was presented in it was ""plain but true"". This was subsequently used by the planters in their prosecution of Long for publishing defamatory statements.

142,id1490,"Passage: A solid bounded by a cylindrical surface and two parallel planes is called a (solid) cylinder. The line segments determined by an element of the cylindrical surface between the two parallel planes is called an element of the cylinder. All the elements of a cylinder have equal lengths. The region bounded by the cylindrical surface in either of the parallel planes is called a base of the cylinder. The two bases of a cylinder are congruent figures. If the elements of the cylinder are perpendicular to the planes containing the bases, the cylinder is a right cylinder, otherwise it is called an oblique cylinder.

560,id3174,"Passage: In June 1919, the Allies declared that war would resume if the German government did not sign the treaty they had agreed to among themselves. The government headed by Philipp Scheidemann was unable to agree on a common position, and Scheidemann himself resigned rather than agree to sign the treaty. Gustav Bauer, the head of the new government, sent a telegram stating his intention to sign the treaty if certain articles were withdrawn, including Articles 227, 230 and 231.[nb 1] In response, the Allies issued an ultimatum stating that Germany would have to accept the treaty or face an invasion of Allied forces across the Rhine within 24 hours. On 23 June, Bauer capitulated and sent a second telegram with a confirmation that a German delegation would arrive shortly to sign the treaty.[40] On 28 June 1919, the fifth anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the immediate impetus for the war), the peace treaty was signed.[2] The treaty had clauses ranging from war crimes, the prohibition on the merging of Austria with Germany without the consent of the League of Nations, freedom of navigation on major European rivers, to the returning of a Koran to the king of Hedjaz.[41][42][43][44]

861,id463,"Passage: Citizens of the war-weary nation wanted stability, peace, and an end to conditions that at times bordered on chaos. Nevertheless, those on the right who wished to restore the monarchy by putting Louis XVIII on the throne, and those on the left who would have renewed the Reign of Terror, tried but failed to overthrow the Directory. The earlier atrocities had made confidence or goodwill between parties impossible.[168] The Directory régime met opposition from Jacobins on the left and royalists on the right (the latter were secretly subsidised by the British government). The army suppressed riots and counter-revolutionary activities. In this way the army and in particular Napoleon gained total power.[citation needed]

The first member to appear on Smallville, other than Clark Kent (Tom Welling), was Bart Allen (Kyle Gallner), who was introduced in the season four episode ""Run"". In the episode, Bart is the first person Clark discovers to have a superhuman ability—being able to run at supersonic speeds—that was not created from exposure to kryptonite. When Clark and Bart first meet, Bart is a pickpocket who saves Jonathan Kent (John Schneider) from being hit by a truck. Eventually, Clark convinces Bart to give up his life of crime.[1] Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson), who has the ability to swim at superhuman speeds and create energy blasts through the water, is next to appear in the season five episode ""Aqua"". Arthur arrives in Smallville to stop an underwater weapon developed by Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), which is killing the surrounding ocean life. Arthur and Clark initially clash on Arthur's tactics; Arthur tries to blow up Lex's lab, while Clark insists that they should simply talk to Lex face-to-face and ask him to stop. Eventually, Arthur and Clark locate and destroy the weapon outright.[2] Season five also introduced Victor Stone (Lee Thompson Young) in the episode ""Cyborg"". Here, it is revealed that Victor was mortally wounded in a car accident that also took the lives of his family, but Lex's company, LuthorCorp, took Victor's body to a research lab where they experimented on him—ultimately replacing his bone skeleton with a metal one. Clark attempts to provide Victor with a safe haven after Victor escapes from Lex's facility. Clark manages to convince Lex to stop hunting Victor, who eventually leaves Smallville with his girlfriend.[3]

Legend has it that these flowers sprung up where drops of Jesus' sweat fell as he prayed"".[4][5] In many Christian churches, the chancel is adorned with Easter lilies throughout the Paschal season.[6][7] A poem of the early 1900s titled Easter Lilies by S.R. Allen, delineates this custom:

143,id1492,"Passage: The concept of the paradise garden (charbagh) was brought from Persia by the Mughals as a form of Timurid garden. They were the first architectural expression the new empire made in the Indian sub-continent, and fulfilled diverse functions with strong symbolic meanings. The symbolism of these gardens is derived from mystic Islamic texts describing paradise as a garden filled with abundant trees, flowers and plants, with water playing a key role: In Paradise four rivers source at a central spring or mountain. In their ideal form they were laid out as a square subdivided into four equal parts. These rivers are often represented in the charbagh as shallow canals which separate the garden by flowing towards the cardinal points. The canals represent the promise of water, milk, wine and honey.[16] The centre of the garden, at the intersection of the divisions is highly symbolically charged and is where, in the ideal form, a pavilion, pool or tomb would be situated. The tombs of Humayun, Akbar and Jahangir, the previous Mughal emperors, follow this pattern. The cross axial garden also finds independent precedents within South Asia dating from the 5th century where the royal gardens of Sigiriya in Sri Lanka were laid out in a similar way.[17]

Possessing a high-powered offense which featured McNabb, Owens, and Brian Westbrook, as well as a bruising defense led by Pro Bowlers Trotter, Brian Dawkins, Lito Sheppard, and Michael Lewis, they steamrolled opponents on the way to a 13–1 start to the season. After resting starters for the final two games, the 13–3 Eagles soared past the Minnesota Vikings and the Atlanta Falcons in the playoffs, earning a trip to Super Bowl XXXIX in Jacksonville against the defending champion New England Patriots.

It has its origin in the attempt to discover first principles – 'those universal principles which are the condition of the possibility of the existence of anything and everything'.[1] The liberal arts are those subjects or skills that in classical antiquity were considered essential for a free person (Latin: liberalis, ""worthy of a free person"")[2] to know in order to take an active part in civic life, something that (for Ancient Greece) included participating in public debate, defending oneself in court, serving on juries, and most importantly, military service.

720,id381,"Passage: In July, the Permanente Foundation formed to operate Northern California hospitals that would be linked to the outpatient health plans, followed shortly thereafter by the creation of Northern Permanente Foundation for Oregon and Washington and Southern Permanente Foundation for California. The name Permanente came from Permanente Creek, which flowed past Henry Kaiser's first cement plant on Black Mountain in Cupertino, California. Kaiser's first wife, Bess Fosburgh, liked the name. An abandoned Oakland facility was modernized as the 170-bed Permanente Hospital opened on August 1, 1942. Three weeks later, the 71-bed Richmond Field Hospital opened. Six first aid stations were set up in the shipyards to treat industrial accidents and minor illness. Each first aid station had an ambulance ready to rush patients to the surgical field hospital if required. Stabilized patients could be moved to the larger hospital for recuperative care.[21] The Northern Permanente Hospital opened two weeks later to serve workers at the Kaiser shipyard in Vancouver, Washington.[22] Shipyard workers paid seven cents per day for comprehensive health care coverage; and within a year the shipyard health plan employed sixty physicians with salaries between $450 and $1,000 per month. These physicians established California Physicians Service to offer similar health coverage to the families of shipyard workers.[21] In 1944, Kaiser decided to continue the program after the war and to open it up to the general public.[18]

The invading Macedonian troops defeated Persia. After the Hellenic League soundly defeated the Persian satraps of Asia Minor (led by Greek mercenary Memnon of Rhodes) at the Battle of the Granicus, Darius took personal command of his army. He gathered reinforcements and led his men in a surprise march behind the Hellenic advance to cut their line of supply.

Each denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier.

K.C., Marisa and the rest of the Coopers flee to a safe house in Rio de Janeiro after Zane and his men target them. After two weeks in the safe house – a run-down apartment – K.C., Ernie and Marisa go into the city to contact The Organization. While in the city, Ernie meets Zoe, a young woman from Kansas who likes him. However, K.C. is suspicious of Zoe and ends their conversation as the Coopers are not to speak to anyone because of the possibility that Zane could be tracking them. K.C. contacts The Organization and learns that Zane is unaware of their whereabouts. K.C. then signs up the family for a mission to capture Passaro Grande, a local smuggler of exotic birds. After capturing Grande, Craig, Kira and Judy take him to the local authorities while K.C., Ernie and Marisa return to the safe house. A strong enemy agent named Sheena, who frequently talks to herself, breaks into the safe house and reveals that she was sent by Zane to kill them. After fighting K.C. and Ernie, Zoe breaks in and knocks out Sheena. Zoe reveals that she is an agent for The Organization who was assigned to protect the family. The group gets into a vehicle to head to a safe location, but K.C. must take a detour through the jungle after learning that Sheena is following them. The next day, Sheena locates the group and incapacitates Ernie, Marisa and Zoe with a small device that electrocutes them. K.C. and Sheena prepare to battle.

During battle, K.C. tosses a Brazilian jumping spider on Sheena to paralyze her. Ernie, Marisa and Zoe regain consciousness and discover that K.C. has also been paralyzed by the spider. They leave Sheena behind and carry K.C. through the jungle. Zoe eventually makes an antidote for K.C. out of jungle vegetation and snake saliva. Meanwhile, Marisa is upset that today is school picture day and she is not there to have her picture taken. Marisa wanted a yearbook picture to remember the fact that she became a high school senior despite her poor grades. After wandering through the jungle, Craig, Kira and Judy find Sheena, who claims to be Zoe. They then find K.C. and the others. K.C. and Zoe apprehend Sheena, and Marisa and the Coopers later board a helicopter. During the flight, Zane reveals himself to be the pilot. Zane destroys the helicopter controls and parachutes out while the helicopter spirals out of control toward the ocean.

The Coopers decide to keep their survival a secret to increase their chances of capturing Zane; they recruit Kira's parents, Othello and Gayle, so they can work together. Disguising her voice as Brett, Judy arranges to meet Zane at a laser tag facility, where K.C. and her family ambush him. After battling with real laser guns, Zane is apprehended, and K.C. declares that they no longer have to worry about The Other Side, unaware that a new enemy organization known as The Alternate has been formed.

K.C. is upset to learn that she has received the same SAT score as Marisa: 1060. K.C. later learns that Beverly had Craig change her SAT result because she received a perfect score. Less than one percent of the population receives a perfect score; leaving the original score intact would draw unnecessary attention to K.C., putting her spy career at risk. K.C. disagrees with Beverly's decision as it will prevent her from being accepted into certain colleges. Beverly tells K.C. that The Organization wants her to remain a spy rather than go to college. K.C. drives to New York to retake her SAT test, while Ernie and Zoe team up for a mission to stop smugglers who are working in a party supplies warehouse. After completing the mission, Ernie asks Zoe to be his girlfriend, but she tells him that she has been assigned to a four-year mission in Antarctica. Ernie agrees to wait for Zoe until she concludes her mission. Meanwhile, Marisa wants K.C. to talk to The Organization about letting her become a spy. Marisa is insulted when K.C. tells her that she is not intelligent enough to be a spy. K.C. later tells Marisa that it would be better if she attended college rather than become a spy. Marisa, who does not want to attend college, becomes further upset at K.C. and decides to temporarily end their friendship. Two months later, K.C. learns that she has received a perfect SAT score.

Meanwhile, Ernie gives Judy an emotion upgrade to increase her mental sensitivity, to help her maintain her cover as a real child.

K.C. suspects that Brady has been spying on her through a necklace that he gave Marisa, who is unaware of Brady's Storm Maker theft. K.C. believes the necklace is bugged, so she creates a plan to trick and catch Brady. K.C. tells Marisa, who is wearing the necklace, that The Organization has created a device called the Rain Coat, capable of stopping the Storm Maker. K.C. also says that she will be dropping off the plans for the device – which is actually fictitious – in an alley later that night, with the hope that Brady will arrive there to steal them. A masked man from The Alternate arrives to intercept the plans, but he is knocked out by K.C., who realizes that the man is not Brady. Three additional masked men arrive, including Brady, but they are forced away when Marisa arrives and threatens them with a laser gun. Meanwhile, Kira is about to enjoy a day off when Lori, an agent of The Organization, drops off her baby at the Coopers' house so she can go on a last-minute mission.

Agent Johnson puts the Coopers in charge of collecting information on Brady. K.C. arranges a job interview for Marisa to become a junior agent-in-training for The Organization, which leads Marisa to question Brady, who had already told her that she was a junior agent. After being questioned, Brady eventually reveals to Marisa that he is a member of The Alternate. Brady also reveals that he has hours of audio footage in which Marisa states that K.C. may have become a rogue agent and agrees to work with him to take her down. Brady blackmails Marisa to continue spying on K.C., or else he will release the audio footage and get her imprisoned for treason against the United States. Marisa confesses to K.C. that she has been spying for Brady, and K.C. discovers that Marisa's necklace was never bugged. When unusual weather begins occurring around the world, the Coopers realize that the Storm Maker has been activated, so they instruct Marisa to gain information from Brady about the device. When Marisa fails, K.C. goes in disguise as Marisa and confronts Brady, who kidnaps and takes her to The Alternate's headquarters, as she planned. Meanwhile, Ernie wants to drive by Monique's house in his father's 1969 classic muscle car, but he crashes it before getting out of the driveway, scraping away the paint on one of the doors. Judy makes the situation worse by repainting the door a different color and then removing the paint entirely. Ernie and Judy blame the damage on The Alternate, but Craig does not believe them.

Craig and Kira drive to the Capitol to warn people, but they encounter heavy rain and hail. Marisa enters The Alternate's headquarters to help K.C., and they rush to the rooftop to destroy the Storm Maker's transmitter.

Judy's memory is almost full, which requires her to visit The Organization to have her video footage downloaded. The Coopers realize that Judy has recorded everything they have done, including things that could get them excluded from The Organization again. The family decides to delete Judy's incriminating videos, including footage showing that Marisa knows about the family being spies. After reminiscing through old footage, Craig deletes several videos, including important footage from their recent circus mission. When the family discovers that the circus footage cannot be recovered, they worry about how Agent Johnson will react to them tampering with evidence. Ernie suggests reenacting the circus mission in their house and filming it to cover for the deletion of the real footage, which leads the family to reminisce through old videos about his previous bad ideas. The family also watches other old videos, until Agent Johnson arrives at the house to pick up Judy. The family hides Judy and convinces Johnson that she has already left to visit The Organization for the memory download. Afterwards, Judy expresses sorrow that her videos will need to be downloaded and removed, as they serve as her memories. Ernie devises a solution to back up Judy's video footage to a separate hard drive so they can be reinstalled onto Judy after she downloads them for The Organization.

The result of the intrusion of North American fauna was that hundreds of South American species became extinct in a relatively short time and that about 60% of present-day South American mammals have evolved from North American species.[3] However, some species were able to adapt and spread into North America. Apart from Pliometanastes, during the Irvingtonian stage of the mammal land stages, around 1.9 Ma, species as Pampatherium, a giant armadillo, ground sloth Megatherium, giant anteater Myrmecophaga, a Neogene capybara (Hydrochoerus), Meizonyx, opossum Didelphis, and Mixotoxodon followed the route north.[4] The terror bird Titanis was the only discovered South American carnivore species who made the journey into North America.[5]

828,id4202,"Passage: An electron transport chain (ETC) is a series of complexes that transfer electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox (both reduction and oxidation occurring simultaneously) reactions, and couples this electron transfer with the transfer of protons (H+ ions) across a membrane. This creates an electrochemical proton gradient that drives the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a molecule that stores energy chemically in the form of highly strained bonds. The molecules of the chain include peptides, enzymes (which are proteins or protein complexes), and others. The final acceptor of electrons in the electron transport chain during aerobic respiration is molecular oxygen although a variety of acceptors other than oxygen such as sulfate exist in anaerobic respiration.

165,id1584,"Passage: 
Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins: a young hobbit who inherits the One Ring from his uncle Bilbo. Wood was the first actor to be cast on 7 July 1999.[12] Wood was a fan of the book, and he sent in an audition dressed as Frodo, reading lines from the novel.[13] Wood was selected from 150 actors who auditioned,[14] including Jake Gyllenhaal.[15]
Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey: an Istari wizard and mentor to Frodo. Sean Connery was approached for the role, but did not understand the plot,[13] while Patrick Stewart turned it down as he disliked the script.[16] Before being cast, McKellen had to sort his schedule with 20th Century Fox as there was a two-month overlap with X-Men.[14] He enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than his transformed state in the next two films,[10] and based his accent on Tolkien. Unlike his on-screen character, McKellen did not spend much time with the actors playing the Hobbits; instead he worked with their scale doubles.[8]
Sean Astin as Samwise ""Sam"" Gamgee: a hobbit gardener and Frodo's best friend. Astin, who had recently become a father, bonded with the 18-year-old Wood in a protective manner, which mirrored Sam's relationship with Frodo.[8]
Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn II Elessar: a Dúnedain ranger, the descendant of Isildur, and heir to Gondor's throne. Daniel Day-Lewis was offered the part at the beginning of pre-production, but turned it down.[17] Nicolas Cage also received an offer, declining because of ""family obligations"",[18] while Vin Diesel, a fan of the book, auditioned for Aragorn. Stuart Townsend was cast in the role, before being replaced during filming when Jackson realised he was too young.[13] Russell Crowe was considered as a replacement, but he turned it down after taking what he thought to be a similar role in Gladiator.[13] Day-Lewis was offered the role for a second time, but declined again.[17] Executive Producer Mark Ordesky saw Mortensen in a play. Mortensen's son, a fan of the book, convinced him to take the role.[8] Mortensen read the book on the plane, received a crash course lesson in fencing from Bob Anderson and began filming the scenes on Weathertop.[19] Mortensen became a hit with the crew by patching up his costume[20] and carrying his ""hero"" sword around with him off-camera.[8]
Billy Boyd as Peregrin ""Pippin"" Took: a hobbit who travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor.
Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc ""Merry"" Brandybuck: a distant cousin of Frodo. Monaghan was cast as Merry after auditioning for Frodo.[13]
John Rhys-Davies as Gimli: a dwarf warrior who accompanies the Fellowship to Mordor after they set out from Rivendell and a descendant of Durin's Folk. Billy Connolly, who was considered for the part of Gimli, later portrayed Dáin II Ironfoot in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film trilogy.[13] Rhys-Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play Gimli, which limited his vision, and eventually developed eczema around his eyes.[8]
Orlando Bloom as Legolas Greenleaf: a prince of the elves' Woodland Realm and a skilled archer. Bloom initially auditioned for Faramir, who appears in the second film, a role which went to David Wenham.[13]
Sean Bean as Boromir: a prince of the Stewards of Gondor who journeys with the Fellowship towards Mordor. Bruce Willis, a fan of the book, expressed interest in the role, while Liam Neeson was sent the script, but passed.[13]
Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins: Frodo's uncle who gives him the Ring after he decides to retire to Rivendell. Holm previously played Frodo in a 1981 radio adaption of The Lord of the Rings, and was cast as Bilbo after Jackson remembered his performance.[13] Sylvester McCoy, who would later play Radagast the Brown in The Hobbit, was contacted about playing the role, and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Holm.[21]
Liv Tyler as Arwen Undomiel: a beautiful half-elf princess of Rivendell and Aragorn's lover. The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in Plunkett & Macleane, and New Line Cinema leaped at the opportunity of having one Hollywood star in the film. Actress Helena Bonham Carter had expressed interest in the role.[13] Peter Jackson wanted to cast Uma Thurman as Arwen, but Thurman pulled out due to pregnancy, Tyler came to shoot on short occasions, unlike the rest of the actors. She was one of the last actors to be cast, on 25 August 1999.[22]
Cate Blanchett as Galadriel: the elven co-ruler of Lothlórien alongside her husband Celeborn. Peter Jackson wanted to cast Lucy Lawless as Galadriel, but she declined due to pregnancy.[23]
Christopher Lee as Saruman the White: the fallen head of the Istari Order who succumbs to Sauron's will through his use of the palantír. Lee was a major fan of the book, and read it once a year. He had also met J. R. R. Tolkien.[19] He originally auditioned for Gandalf, but was judged too old.[13]
Hugo Weaving as Elrond: the elven Lord of Rivendell who leads the Council of Elrond, which ultimately decides to destroy the Ring. David Bowie expressed interest in the role, but Jackson stated, ""To have a famous, beloved character and a famous star colliding is slightly uncomfortable.""[14]
Sala Baker as Sauron: the Dark Lord of Mordor and the Ring's true master who manifests as an Eye after the destruction of his physical form. Originally hired as one of the several stunt performers for the film trilogy, Baker ended up landing the role. In addition, he went on to play several Orcs as well.
Andy Serkis as Gollum voice and motion capture: a wretched hobbit-like creature whose mind was poisoned over centuries by the Ring.
David Weatherley as Barliman Butterbur, proprietor in Bree
Lawrence Makoare as Lurtz: the commander of Saruman's Orc forces;
Marton Csokas as Celeborn: the elven co-ruler of Lothlórien alongside his wife Galadriel;
Craig Parker as Haldir: the leader of the Galadhrim warriors guarding the border of Lothlórien;
Mark Ferguson as Ereinion Gil-galad, the last Elven-King of Noldor;
Peter McKenzie as Elendil the Tall: the last High King of Arnor and Gondor;
Harry Sinclair as Isildur: Elendil's son and Aragorn's ancestor who originally defeated Sauron.

His first plays were written later than those of Aeschylus, and earlier than or contemporary with those of Euripides. Sophocles wrote over 120 plays[3] during the course of his life, but only seven have survived in a complete form: Ajax, Antigone, The Women of Trachis, Oedipus Rex, Electra, Philoctetes and Oedipus at Colonus.[4] For almost 50 years, Sophocles was the most celebrated playwright in the dramatic competitions of the city-state of Athens that took place during the religious festivals of the Lenaea and the Dionysia. He competed in 30 competitions, won 24, and was never judged lower than second place. Aeschylus won 13 competitions, and was sometimes defeated by Sophocles, while Euripides won 4 competitions.[5]

792,id4058,"Passage: The repeatedly mentioned phrase ""the day the music died"" refers to the plane crash in 1959 which killed early rock and roll performers Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens. (The crash was not known by that name until after McLean's song became a hit.) The meaning of the other lyrics has long been debated, and for decades, McLean declined to explain the symbolism behind the many characters and events mentioned. However, the overall theme of the song is the loss of innocence of the early rock and roll generation as symbolized by the plane crash which claimed the lives of three of its heroes.[2]

407,id2552,"Passage: The Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada. On November 1, 1946, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens, in a game the NBA now refers to as the first played game in NBA history.[6] The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the American Basketball League and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters. For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948–49 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.[7]

He later asked her to marry him, and indicated that he was willing to give up his detective's shield in order to help take care of the baby and allow JJ to continue to do her job, though he was worried about her safety and the safety of their child.[11] JJ later told Hotch she had found a temporary replacement for the duration of her maternity leave,[12] and soon after gave birth to a baby boy named Henry. Will transfers to the MPDC, and the family live together in Washington.[13] In later seasons, toddler Henry is portrayed by actress A. J. Cook's real-life son Mekhai Andersen. JJ and Will named Reid and Technical Analyst Penelope Garcia as Henry's godparents. When JJ returned from maternity leave, she and Will had exchanged rings with Henry's birthstone, but did not seem to be officially engaged, as she wore her ring on her right hand, not the left. In the season seven finale, JJ tearfully asked Will to propose to her again, and they married the following evening in a small ceremony in David Rossi's backyard.

398,id2522,"Passage: In social relationships, an ex (plural is exes) is someone with whom a person was once associated, in a relationship, marriage, or once talked to. As a prefix, ex- can refer to a variety of different relationships; for example, one might refer to a music group's ex-guitarist, or someone's ex-friend.[1] When used alone, ex as a noun is assumed to refer to a former sexual or romantic partner, especially a former spouse. This often has a derogatory tinge, especially if it refers to unrequited feelings.

393,id2498,"Passage: In 1985, the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued OMB Circular A-128, “Audits of State and Local Governments,” to help recipients and auditors implement the new Single Audit. In 1990, OMB administratively extended the Single Audit process to non-profit organizations by issuing OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit Organizations” which superseded OMB A-128. These new guides and provisions standardized the Single Audit in the United States to include all states, local governments, non-profit organizations, and institutions that receive federal funds from the US government.[2][5][6] On December 26, 2013, OMB issued the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, which standardized compliance and audit requirements for government entities, non-profit organizations and institutions of higher education.[7]

742,id3886,"Passage: As with all casino games, blackjack incorporates a ""house edge"", a statistical advantage for the casino that is built into the game. The advantage of the dealer's position in blackjack relative to the player comes from the fact that if the player busts, the player loses, regardless of whether the dealer subsequently busts. Nonetheless, blackjack players using basic strategy will lose less than 1% of their total wagered amount with strictly average luck; this is very favorable to the player compared to other casino games. The loss rate of players who deviate from basic strategy through ignorance is generally expected to be greater.

Maryland was notable for having been established with religious freedom for Roman Catholics.[1][2][3] Like other colonies of the Chesapeake Bay, its economy was based on tobacco as a commodity crop, cultivated primarily by African slave labor, although many young people came from Britain as indentured servants in the early years.

642,id3488,"Passage: Parietal cells (also known as oxyntic or delomorphous cells), are the epithelial cells that secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl) and intrinsic factor. These cells are located in the gastric glands found in the lining of the fundus and in the body of the stomach. They contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the HCl is secreted by active transport into the stomach. The enzyme hydrogen potassium ATPase (H+/K+ ATPase) is unique to the parietal cells and transports the H+ against a concentration gradient of about 3 million to 1, which is the steepest ion gradient formed in the human body. Parietal cells are primarily regulated via histamine, acetylcholine and gastrin signaling from both central and local modulators (see 'Regulation').

Upset, Clary seeks solace at the Brooklyn Academy of Art where she is kidnapped by Dot and taken to Valentine. With Clary missing, Jocelyn offers her assistance to Isabelle and Alec by providing adamas, a metal that can be used to track Jace using his and Alec's bond. Meanwhile at Camille's Indian residence, Simon and Magnus search for the vampire, whom Raphael is being pressured by the Clave to produce, and find some items from Magnus' past. With Dot's help, Jace and Clary flee Valentine's ship, but not before the risky parabatai tracking renders Alec comatose.

Jace is freed from the City of Bones, but Aldertree, still suspicious of Jace, bans him from the field of duty. Clary seeks the help of a warlock named Iris Rouse to resurrect Jocelyn and swears a blood oath to provide a favor in return for the spell. Isabelle's wound from her possession is not healing, so Aldertree prescribes a drug named yin fen. Iris traps Clary with the intention of claiming her favor: mating her with a demon in order to create more warlocks. Jace, Isabelle, and Alec arrive to save her, but Clary creates a new rune that helps her escape. Simon struggles with his double life as he moves back home and eventually admits his vampirism to his mother, but his confession goes awry and Raphael wipes his mother's memory.

Simon and Maia team up to find Luke and begin to form a bond. Alec and Magnus go on their first date and discover a disparity in their romantic pasts. Isabelle and Clary go to the Iron Sisters for help in defeating Valentine and meet Luke's sister, Cleophas. To enter the Citadel, the two must endure a trial which detects demon impurities; Clary passes, but Isabelle fails and is informed that yin fen she has been using is made of vampire venom. Maia and Simon find Luke and convince him to return to the pack. Cleophas tells Clary that the Soul Sword has a second purpose: it can kill all demon-blooded creatures, including Downworlders. Clary shows Cleophas her runic power. Magnus and Alec decide to begin a relationship, despite their differences, but are surprised by Jace's appearance: he has left the Institute due to Aldertree's treatment and asks to stay with Magnus. Later, Cleophas kills Magdelena, an Iron Sister, and activates a Circle rune, indicating her allegiance to Valentine.

111,id1370,"Passage: ""Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)"" was the second single from Marvin Gaye's 1971 album, What's Going On. Following the breakthrough of the title track's success, the song, written solely by Gaye, became regarded as one of popular music's most poignant anthems of sorrow regarding the environment. Led by Gaye playing piano, strings conducted by Paul Riser and David Van De Pitte, multi-tracking vocals from Gaye and The Andantes, multiple background instruments provided by The Funk Brothers and a leading sax solo by Wild Bill Moore, the song rose to number 4 on Billboard's Pop Singles chart and number one for two weeks on the R&B Singles charts on August 14 through to August 27, 1971.[1] The distinctive percussive sound heard on the track was a wood block struck by a rubber mallet, drenched in studio reverb.[2] The song also brought Gaye one of his rare appearances on the Adult Contemporary chart, where it peaked at number 34. In Canada, ""Mercy Mercy Me"" spent two weeks at number 9.[3]

Some manufacturers do refer to their products as SUVs, but others invented names such as XUV,[75] (HSV Avalanche XUV or GMC Envoy XUV) or action utility vehicles (AUVs).[76] The term ""AWD"", or all-wheel drive, is used for any vehicle which drives on all four wheels, but may not be designed for off-road use.

760,id3944,"Passage: Bacterial operons are polycistronic transcripts that are able to produce multiple proteins from one mRNA transcript. In this case, when lactose is required as a sugar source for the bacterium, the three genes of the lac operon can be expressed and their subsequent proteins translated: lacZ, lacY, and lacA.

On land most phosphorus is found in rocks and minerals. Phosphorus rich deposits have generally formed in the ocean or from guano, and over time, geologic processes bring ocean sediments to land. Weathering of rocks and minerals release phosphorus in a soluble form where it is taken up by plants, and it is transformed into organic compounds. The plants may then be consumed by herbivores and the phosphorus is either incorporated into their tissues or excreted. After death, the animal or plant decays, and phosphorus is returned to the soil where a large part of the phosphorus is transformed into insoluble compounds. Runoff may carry a small part of the phosphorus back to the ocean. Generally with time (thousands of years) soils become deficient in phosphorus leading to ecosystem retrogression.[4]

It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins),[3] although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence.

728,id3832,"Passage: where C6H12O6 is glucose (which is subsequently transformed into other sugars, cellulose, lignin, and so forth). The value of the photosynthetic efficiency is dependent on how light energy is defined – it depends on whether we count only the light that is absorbed, and on what kind of light is used (see Photosynthetically active radiation). It takes eight (or perhaps 10 or more[1]) photons to utilize one molecule of CO2. The Gibbs free energy for converting a mole of CO2 to glucose is 114 kcal, whereas eight moles of photons of wavelength 600 nm contains 381 kcal, giving a nominal efficiency of 30%.[2] However, photosynthesis can occur with light up to wavelength 720 nm so long as there is also light at wavelengths below 680 nm to keep Photosystem II operating (see Chlorophyll). Using longer wavelengths means less light energy is needed for the same number of photons and therefore for the same amount of photosynthesis. For actual sunlight, where only 45% of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range, the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11%. In actuality, however, plants do not absorb all incoming sunlight (due to reflection, respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels) and do not convert all harvested energy into biomass, which results in an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6% of total solar radiation.[1] If photosynthesis is inefficient, excess light energy must be dissipated to avoid damaging the photosynthetic apparatus. Energy can be dissipated as heat (non-photochemical quenching), or emitted as chlorophyll fluorescence.

Methane, emitted by the digestion of food by animals, for example cattle
Radon gas from radioactive decay within the Earth's crust. Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive noble gas that is formed from the decay of radium. It is considered to be a health hazard. Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings, especially in confined areas such as the basement and it is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer, after cigarette smoking.
Smoke and carbon monoxide from wildfires
Vegetation, in some regions, emits environmentally significant amounts of Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on warmer days. These VOCs react with primary anthropogenic pollutants—specifically, NOx, SO2, and anthropogenic organic carbon compounds — to produce a seasonal haze of secondary pollutants.[20] Black gum, poplar, oak and willow are some examples of vegetation that can produce abundant VOCs.

732,id3844,"Passage: The Easter Bunny (also called the Easter Rabbit or Easter Hare) is a folkloric figure and symbol of Easter, depicted as a rabbit bringing Easter eggs. Originating among German Lutherans, the ""Easter Hare"" originally played the role of a judge, evaluating whether children were good or disobedient in behavior at the start of the season of Eastertide.[1] The Easter Bunny is sometimes depicted with clothes. In legend, the creature carries colored eggs in his basket, candy, and sometimes also toys to the homes of children, and as such shows similarities to Santa Claus or the Christkind, as they both bring gifts to children on the night before their respective holidays. The custom was first[2][unreliable source?] mentioned in Georg Franck von Franckenau's De ovis paschalibus[3] ('About Easter Eggs') in 1682, referring to a German tradition of an Easter Hare bringing Easter eggs for the children.

219,id1812,"Passage: Arousal regulation refers to entering into and maintaining an optimal level of cognitive and physiological activation in order to maximize performance. This may include relaxation if one becomes too anxious through methods such as progressive muscle relaxation, breathing exercises, and meditation, or the use of energizing techniques (e.g., listening to music, energizing cues) if one is not alert enough.[46] The use of meditation and specifically, mindfulness, is a growing practice in the field of arousal recognition. The Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment (MAC) Theory is the most common form of mindfulness in sport and was formed in 2001. The aim of MAC is to maximize human potential for a rich, full and meaningful life.[47] It includes specific protocol that involve meditation and acceptance practices on a regular basis as well as before and during competition. These protocol have been tested various times using NCAA men's and women's basketball players. In a study done by Frank L. Gardner, an NCAA women's basketball player increased her personal satisfaction in her performances from 2.4 out of 10 to 9.2 out of 10 after performing the specific MAC protocol for several weeks. Also, the effect of mental barriers on her game decreased from 8 out of 8 to 2.2 out of 8 during that same time period as a result of the MAC protocol.[48] Another study of the MAC protocol performed by Frank Gardner and Zella Moore on an adolescent competitive diver showed that when the MAC protocol is tailored to a specific population, it has the potential to provide performance enhancement. In this case, the vocabulary and examples in the protocol were tailored to be more practical for a 12-year-old. After performed the MAC protocol for several weeks, the diver showed between a 13 to 14 percent increase in his diving scores.[49] This finding is important because previously the majority of tests performed using the MAC protocol had been on world class athletes.

Most water in the Earth's atmosphere and crust comes from the world ocean's saline seawater, while freshwater accounts for only 2.5% of the total. Because the oceans that cover roughly 78% of the area of the Earth reflect blue light, the Earth appears blue from space, and is often referred to as the blue planet and the Pale Blue Dot.

856,id447,"Passage: Defence Against the Dark Arts, commonly shortened to D.A.D.A.,[21] is the class that teaches students defensive techniques to defend against the Dark Arts, and to be protected from Dark creatures. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, with Death-Eaters in charge of the school, the subject is renamed the Dark Arts, and involves pupils practicing the Cruciatus Curse on those who have earned detentions.[DH Ch.29] The subject has an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members—throughout the series no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has retained the post for more than one school year. Harry is exceptionally skilled in this subject. During the period the story takes place, the class is taught by Quirinus Quirrell (book one), Gilderoy Lockhart (book two), Remus Lupin (book three), Bartemius Crouch Jr impersonating Alastor ""Mad-eye"" Moody (book four), Dolores Umbridge (book five), Severus Snape (book six), and Amycus Carrow (book seven). Hagrid suggests in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets that ""They're startin' ter think the job's jinxed. No one's lasted long for a while now."" In Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore suggests that Voldemort cursed the position because his application for it was rejected.[HBP Ch.20] The existence of the jinx was eventually confirmed by Rowling. The position had also been coveted by Snape, but he was denied the position as well. Snape was finally appointed D.A.D.A. professor in Half-Blood Prince. Rowling announced in an interview that once Voldemort had died, the jinx he placed on the office was lifted and a permanent professor had been teaching the subject between the end of Deathly Hallows and the epilogue, set nineteen years afterwards.

He made close observations of cells and leaves and divided plants into Dvimatrka (Dicotyledons) and Ekamatrka (Monocotyledons). The dicotyledons were further classified into groupings (ganas) akin to modern floral families: Samiganiya (Fabaceae), Puplikagalniya (Rutaceae), Svastikaganiya (Cruciferae), Tripuspaganiya (Cucurbitaceae), Mallikaganiya (Apocynaceae), and Kurcapuspaganiya (Asteraceae).[32][33] Important medieval Indian works of plant physiology include the Prthviniraparyam of Udayana, Nyayavindutika of Dharmottara, Saddarsana-samuccaya of Gunaratna, and Upaskara of Sankaramisra.

804,id4108,"Passage: One of the most notable effects of the adoption of the Charter was to greatly expand the scope of judicial review, because the Charter is more explicit with respect to the guarantee of rights and the role of judges in enforcing them than was the Bill of Rights. The courts, when confronted with violations of Charter rights, have struck down unconstitutional federal and provincial statutes and regulations or parts of statutes and regulations, as they did when Canadian case law was primarily concerned with resolving issues of federalism. The Charter, however, granted new powers to the courts to enforce remedies that are more creative and to exclude more evidence in trials. These powers are greater than what was typical under the common law and under a system of government that, influenced by Canada's parent country the United Kingdom, was based upon Parliamentary supremacy. As a result, the Charter has attracted both broad support from a majority of the Canadian electorate and criticisms by opponents of increased judicial power. The Charter only applies to government laws and actions (including the laws and actions of federal, provincial, and municipal governments and public school boards), and sometimes to the common law, not to private activity.

The British paid little attention to the war, concentrating instead on their final defeat of Napoleon in 1815.

Owades, PhD, a biochemist working for New York's Rheingold Brewery,[3] the recipe was given by Owades to Chicago's Peter Hand Brewing.[4] That year, Peter Hand Brewing was purchased by a group of investors, renamed Meister Brau Brewing, and Lite was soon introduced as Meister Brau Lite, a companion to their flagship Meister Brau. Under the new management, Meister Brau Brewing encountered significant financial problems, and in 1972, sold several of its existing labels to Miller. The recipe was relaunched simply as ""Lite"" on packaging and in advertising (with ""Lite Beer from Miller"" being its ""official"" name until the late '90s) in the test markets of Springfield, Illinois, Knoxville, Tennessee, and San Diego, California, in 1973, and heavily marketed using masculine pro sports players and other, so-called, macho figures of the day in an effort to sell to the key beer-drinking male demographic. Miller Lite was introduced nationally in 1975.[5] Miller's heavy-advertising approach worked where the two previous light beers had failed, and Miller's early production totals of 12.8 million barrels quickly increased to 24.2 million barrels by 1977 as Miller rose to 2nd place in the American brewing marketplace. Other brewers responded, in particular Anheuser-Busch with its heavily advertised Bud Light in 1982, which eventually overtook Lite in sales by 1994. Anheuser-Busch played on the branding style of ""Lite"" by highlighting the fact that their beer was called ""Bud Light,"" as ""everything else is just a light."" In 1992, light beers became the biggest domestic beer in America, and in 1998, Miller relabeled its ""Lite"" brand as ""Miller Lite.""[citation needed]

761,id3950,"Passage: As a result of the battle, the Roman army, commanded by Marcus Atilius Regulus, landed in Africa and began ravaging the Carthaginian countryside.[49] The Siege of Aspis (or Clupea) was the first fighting on African land during the war. Regulus was next victorious at the Battle of Adys, forcing Carthage to sue for peace.[50] According to Polybius, the terms suggested were so heavy that Carthage decided they would be better off not under Roman rule. The negotiations failed but fortunately, for the Carthaginians, Xanthippus, a Spartan mercenary, returned to Carthage to reorganise its army.[33][51] Xanthippus defeated the Roman army and captured Regulus at the Battle of Tunis,[52][53] and then managed to cut off what remained of the Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy.[54][55]

The former confers executive power upon the President alone, and the latter grants judicial power solely to the federal judiciary. These three articles create a separation of powers among the three branches of the federal government.

Spring/summer 1253 was also noted as dry/hot London/south.[3]


1315-17
Great Famine of 1315–17

The climatological summer (June, July and August) of 1666 was amongst the top 10 or so of warm summers in the Central English Temperatures (CET) series (began 1659). CET also suggests that July 1666 had a mean value of 18 °C (64 °F), and August was 17 °C (63 °F). The heat and long drought added to a heightened risk of fire in populated areas. Lack of rain and hot temperatures helped spark the Great Fire of London.[7] As a result, this year saw an end to the Great Plague of London due to extreme heat and fire.

The wettest area, with over 75 mm (3.0 in), stretched from Worcestershire towards The Wash and the flooded towns included Evesham, Leamington Spa, Stratford-upon-Avon, Bedford, Northampton and Huntingdon. On Maundy Thursday (9 April), thundery rain in the south of England moved northwards and became slow-moving from East Anglia through the Midlands to north Wales. This band gave some very heavy downpours with hail and thunder. On Good Friday (10th) the band rotated slowly anticlockwise spreading to Lincolnshire and the West Country and continued to rotate, with sleet and heavy bursts of rain in places. There was sleet and snow across the Pennines and north Wales during the evening.[21]

Many settlements along the coast were severely flooded, with sea defences breached in many locations.


2013-2014
Winter Storms of 2013-14
During the winter of 2013–14 the British Isles were in the path of several winter storms, which culminated in serious coastal damage and widespread persistent flooding. The storms brought the greatest January rainfall in Southern England since at least the year records began in 1910.

Ray is planning to get Mickey out of his sticky situation with the cops by working with old employer Lee Drexler. Ray gets Lee to act as a legal representative for Mickey. Their angle is to say that Mickey is senile, which is signed off on by a doctor whom they pay, and then appoint Ray as his guardian. That means that Mickey can’t rightfully participate in Muncie’s sting. Ray also tries to convince the Minassians to let Mickey out of the deal they made, and asks for help from an Armenian pop star whom Ray had helped out in the past. Meanwhile, Cochran is gathering more evidence in his investigation of Ray, using the vetting of the Finney NFL deal as a reason to dig into any potential dirty business. Cochran is getting closer to learning the truth. He meets with Finney, gets a sense of where he stands, and also bribes his way into Avi’s storage locker. Worried about Bridget, Abby searches her room for something that will help her figure out what’s wrong. She finds Mr. Donellen’s pill bottle and confronts Bridget about it. When Abby learns the truth, she first threatens to call the cops. Donellen lies to Abby telling her that Bridget is obsessed with him because they both lost loved ones.

Cochran arrives home to find Ray there, Ray asks where the poker is, but it takes a bullet to the leg and some persuasion to get the location. Ray recovers the poker just before the police arrive – Lena speeds it away. Bridget, though grounded, visits Donellen and tells him how she feels but he gently rebuffs her. Abby arrives and takes Bridget away. Terry makes a pass at Abby. Ray intercepts Paige on her way into the LAPD offices and he tries to convince her to tell the truth. She tells the police that Finney killed Varick and that they were lovers. Ray and his team deposit the body and poker in a dumpster at Finney’s home. Paige tells Finney she made her statement, but not its contents, and Lena torches the body. Ray and his team return a bruised Cochran to Dybek. Mickey avoids having to move to Reno by convincing his boys he has Alzheimer’s, and claims that he is scared that Ray will lock him away somewhere. Ray confronts Mickey, and Mickey tells Ray they will all hate him if he is sent away, forcing Ray to relent.

427,id2640,"Passage: Ashes are ceremonially placed on the heads of Christians on Ash Wednesday, either by being sprinkled over their heads or, in English-speaking countries, more often by being marked on their foreheads as a visible cross. The words (based on Genesis 3:19) used traditionally to accompany this gesture are, ""Memento, homo, quia pulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris."" (""Remember, man, that thou art dust, and to dust thou shalt return."") This custom is credited to Pope Gregory I the Great (c. 540–604).[26] In the 1969 revision of the Roman Rite, an alternative formula (based on Mark 1:15) was introduced and given first place ""Repent, and believe in the Gospel"" and the older formula was translated as ""Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return."" The old formula, based on the words spoken to Adam and Eve after their sin,[27] reminds worshippers of their sinfulness and mortality and thus, implicitly, of their need to repent in time.[28] The newer formula makes explicit what was only implicit in the old.

The central stroke of an s is called the spine.[5] When the stroke is part of a lowercase[2] and rises above the height of an x (called the x height), it is called an ascender.[6] Letters with ascenders are b d f h k l. A stroke which drops below the baseline is a descender.[6] Letters with descenders are g j p q y. An arching stroke is called a shoulder as in the top of an R[2] or sometimes just an arch, as in h n m. A closed curved stroke is called a bowl in b d o p q D O P Q ; B has two bowls. A trailing outstroke, as in j y J Q R is called a tail.

This is illustrated by the ""Power and Control Wheel,"" a graphic typically displayed as a poster in participating locations.[5][6] According to the Duluth Model, ""women and children are vulnerable to violence because of their unequal social, economic, and political status in society.""[7] Treatment of abusive men is focused on re-education, as ""we do not see men’s violence against women as stemming from individual pathology, but rather from a socially reinforced sense of entitlement.""

High doses of many shorter-acting benzodiazepines may also cause anterograde amnesia and dissociation.[4] These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating anxiety, insomnia, agitation, seizures, muscle spasms, alcohol withdrawal and as a premedication for medical or dental procedures.[5] Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short-, intermediate-, or long-acting. Short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia; longer-acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety.[6]

Gearing is employed in the transmission, which contains a number of different sets of gears that can be changed to allow a wide range of vehicle speeds, and also in the differential, which contains the final drive to provide further speed reduction at the wheels. In addition, the differential contains further gearing that splits torque equally between the two wheels while permitting them to have different speeds when travelling in a curved path. The transmission and final drive might be separate and connected by a driveshaft, or they might be combined into one unit called a transaxle. The gear ratios in transmission and final drive are important because different gear ratios will change the characteristics of a vehicle's performance.

782,id4026,"Passage: As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[19][21] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.[16][21][22]

It only mentions that he moved to Barcelona in February 2001 and that during his first year, he rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict, being limited to friendlies and the Catalan league. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot determine the exact date of his first game for Barcelona.",0.039999999999999994,271,2004,0.6666666666666666,202,"During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league.",0.0,234,2000,0.0,202, 2001,1.0,202,2001,1.0,202,"Unfortunately there is no information in the passage that indicates when Lionel Messi played his first game for Barcelona.

561,id3184,"Passage: American foreign policy was largely determined by President Woodrow Wilson, who had shown little interest in foreign affairs before entering the White House in 1913. His chief advisor was ""Colonel"" Edward House, who was sent on many top-level missions. With the outbreak of war in 1914, the United States declared neutrality and worked to broker a peace. It insisted on its neutral rights, which included allowing private corporations and banks to sell or loan money to either side. With the British blockade, there were almost no sales or loans to Germany, only to the Allies. The widely publicized German atrocities in Germany Shocked American public opinion. Neutrality was supported by Irish-Americans, who hated Britain, by German Americans who wanted to remain neutral, and by women and the churches. It was supported by the more educated upscale WASP element, led by Theodore Roosevelt. Wilson insisted on neutrality, denouncing both British and German violations, especially those German violations in which American civilians were killed. The German U-boat torpedoed the RMS Lusitania in 1915. It sank in 20 minutes, killing killed 128 American civilians and over 1000 Britons. It was against the laws of war to sink any passenger ship without allowing the passengers to reach the life boats. American opinion turned strongly against Germany as a bloodthirsty threat to civilization.[38] Germany apologized and repeatedly promised to stop attacks by its U-boats, but reversed course in early 1917 when it saw the opportunity to strangle Britain by unrestricted submarine warfare. It also made overtures to Mexico, in the Zimmermann Telegram, hoping to divert American military attention to south of the border. The German decision was not made or approved by the civilian government in Berlin, the by the military commanders and the Kaiser. They realized it meant war with the United States, but hoped to weaken the British by cutting off its imports, and strike a winning below with German soldiers transferred from the Eastern front, where Russia had surrendered. Following the repeated sinking of American merchant ships in early 1917, Wilson asked and obtained a declaration of war in April 1917. He neutralized the antiwar element by arguing this was a war With the main goal of ending aggressive militarism and indeed ending all wars. During the war the U.S. was not officially tied to the Allies by treaty, but military cooperation meant that the American contribution became significant in mid-1918. After the failure of the German spring offensive, as fresh American troops arrived in France at 10,000 a day, the Germans were in a hopeless position, and surrendered. Coupled with Wilson's Fourteen Points in January 1918, the U.S. now had the initiative on the military, diplomatic and public relations fronts. Wilsonianism-- Wilson's ideals--had become the hope of the world, including the civilian population Germany itself.[39]

The convergence of race and slavery, politics, and economics raised almost all South-related policy questions to the status of moral questions over way of life, commingling love of things Southern and hatred of things Yankee (the North). Not only did national political parties split, but national churches and interstate families as well divided along sectional lines as the war approached.[16] According to historian John M.

Over the course of years, Larson wrote hundreds of songs and made many drastic changes to the show, which in its final incarnation contained 42 songs. In the fall of 1992, Larson approached James Nicola, artistic director of New York Theatre Workshop, with a tape and copy of Rent's script. When Rent had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993, it became evident that, despite its very promising material and moving musical numbers, many structural problems needed to be addressed, including its cumbersome length and overly complex plot.[7]

However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporary business computers.

They may be employed by police or other authorities to identify individuals who wish to conceal their identity, or to identify people who are incapacitated or deceased and thus unable to identify themselves, as in the aftermath of a natural disaster. Fingerprint analysis, in use since the early 20th century, has led to many crimes being solved.[3] This means that many criminals consider gloves essential.[4][5] In 2015, the identification of sex by use of a fingerprint test has been reported.[6][7]

961,id851,"Passage: Twisty the Clown (portrayed by John Carroll Lynch) originally was a slow-witted but gentle clown at a freak show in 1943. Jealous of his popularity, the freaks of the carnival spread rumors that he was a child molester and drove him away. With nowhere else to go, he returned home to Jupiter, Florida, only to find that his mother had died. After failing to support himself by selling toys made of junk to a local toy store, Twisty attempted suicide by putting a shotgun in his mouth. However, the attempt failed – he succeeded only in mutilating his lower jaw – and he later began to wear a grinning mask over the lower part of his face. Twisty then tried to perform as a clown at Elsa's freak show, but was turned away. Twisty then snapped and went on a killing spree, abducting children to be his audience, while murdering their ""mean"" parents. He kidnaps Corey Bachman and murders his parents, after kidnapping Bonnie Lipton to serve as his audience's babysitter. Gloria hires Twisty to entertain Dandy, who becomes his accomplice. Twisty and Dandy hold a magic show on Halloween, before Jimmy knocks Dandy unconscious and Maggie gets Corey and Bonnie to safety. Twisty then knocks Jimmy out before encountering Edward Mordrake, who was attracted by the noise of the clown's performance. Twisty tells Mordrake his story, and Mordrake deems the clown suitable to be in his entourage of damned souls and kills him. When Elsa summons Mordrake in 1962, Twisty appears alongside the other freaks and comforts her in her last moments. According to director Ryan Murphy, Lynch was so terrifying as this character that ""half the time, almost a third of the crew left the set when they shot his scenes because they were afraid of him."" In Cult, a comic book detailing a fictionalized version of Twisty is owned by Oz Mayfair-Richards.
